MOTION -- flat out -- it\\'s us -- we\\'re running -- stumbling -- breathing rushed -- blood in the snow... We are JASON BOURNE and we\\'re running down an alley... Supered below:   MOSCOW BLUE LIGHTS -- from the distance -- strobing through the night -- rushing toward us -- POLICE CARS -- three of them - - SIRENS HOWLING as they bear down -- closer -- faster -- until they whip past the alley... Up against the wall -- BOURNE is hidden in the shadows. BOURNE is badly wounded -- shot through the shoulder -- bruises and broken bones from the final car chase in With a GROAN, he lifts himself up, staggers across a park toward a PHARMACY... ROWS of MEDICINE and FIRST AID supplies, and in the background, a DOOR being jimmied...It\\'s BOURNE...The ALARM goes off... VICODIN, as BOURNE grabs it...Then PENICILLIN... Then SURGICAL SUPPLIES: Scalpel...Forceps...Sutures...Cotton gauze...Betadine... BOURNE finds a large sink...Rests his gun there...Lays out SURGICAL SUPPLIES...Checks out his back in the mirror...Opens the capsules of penicillin and pours the powder directly into the wound...Begins treating himself... A POLICE CAR pulls up to the curb, lights flashing. One POLICEMAN goes to the jimmied DOOR. SECOND POLICEMAN sees blood and footprints. He motions to his partner to follow... BOURNE finishing up -- splashes water on his face -- he seems a man on a mission. He looks up -- His face... \"\" written on a building. Welcome to the program... POV Bourne walks down a corridor (corridor #). The cops approaching. Daniels leading Bourne down the corridor. You\\'ll be saving American lives. A black sack is thrown over Bourne\\'s head, then: Professor, Jarda, the blonde guy in Paris, Mr. And Mrs. Neski... And finally. BANG -- Marie hit in the head.      The car off the bridge. She sinks away dead... The POLICE enter the back room, guns drawn. Put your hands on your head and turn around slowly! BOURNE snaps out of it, doesn\\'t move. POLICEMAN # (older) approaches him. When BOURNE doesn\\'t respond to his questions, the POLICEMAN starts forward. BOURNE turns and in one motion grabs his gun from the sink and disables the BOURNE freezes POLICEMAN # with his gun and a look. Give me your gun and radio. POLICEMAN #\\'s gun and radio skittle across the floor. My argument is not with you. BOURNE smashes the radio and takes the gun. BOURNE exits... A TITLE fades in -- SUPER:    Six Weeks Later Establishing shot -- CIA Headquarters A workman installs a nameplate that reads:    Ezra Kramer, Director, CIA. Kramer listens to a recording with Landy and Cronin. There are unhung pictures and a few other items that indicate he has just moved into this job. Two other senior CIA officials sit in on the meeting. Kramer looks at a file on Bourne and Abbott. So we got in the way?   Is that why Neski died? Is that why you killed Marie? Kramer glances at a photo of Marie in the file. You killed Marie the minute you climbed into her car.   The minute you entered her life she was dead! Kramer looks at Abbott\\'s official photo. I told you people to leave me alone! I fell off the grid. I was half way around the world. There\\'s no place it won\\'t catch up to you. It\\'s how every story ends. It\\'s what you are, Jason. A killer! You always will be. We think that\\'s Bourne hitting him on the head and then-- He makes a gun with his hand, i.e. Bourne putting his gun to Abbott\\'s head. Go ahead!     Go on! Do it! She wouldn\\'t want me to. That\\'s the only reason your alive. The tape clicks off. Who\\'s \"she?\" CRONIN puts a picture of MARIE in front of KRAMER. His girlfriend, Marie. She was killed in India three weeks ago. Kramer looks down at another image.     Abbott dead after his suicide. A dirty section chief in league with a corrupt Russian Billionaire commits suicide when confronted by Jason Bourne. You couldn\\'t make this stuff up. (holds up the photo of Abbot dead) You watched this happen? Landy nods.   Kramer shakes his head in disgust at the whole situation. Bourne\\'s last confirmed location is Moscow, three days ago? Right. So what does he do now? I think he\\'s looking for something he hasn\\'t found. Like what?     What\\'s he after? I\\'m not sure. Maybe he hasn\\'t gotten his memory back yet.  Not all of it. A look from Kramer... Pam, what I need to know is, what kind of a threat is he to us? If he just wanted to hurt us he could have sent this tape to CNN. Maybe he still will. Maybe he gave it to you because he wants to throw you in the opposite direction of his real plan. I don\\'t know. I just know my number one rule is \"the only way to stay safe is to assume the worst.\"   As far as I\\'m concerned Bourne is a serious threat until proven otherwise. ROSS interviews DANIELS, a TAPE RECORDER on the table between them. ROSS shows DANIELS some of the evidence he\\'s assembled...WANTED POSTERS of JASON BOURNE. ...This one\\'s three years ago -- had half of Interpol after him -- disappeared...Turned up in Naples -- Berlin -- Moscow -- disappeared again... The girl he was on he run with -- Marie Kreutz -- she turned up dead halfway around the world, from a sniper\\'s bullet... What connects the dots? Is it Treadstone? Turn off that tape recorder. The charm of old Paris captured in the workings of an elevator operating in a wrought-iron shaft... A WORK TABLE, covered with sheet music, music paper, pencils. And, sitting on the upright piano against the wall, a framed PHOTO of MARIE... A KNOCK on a door beautifully, heavily lacquered with centuries of paint... MARTIN KREUTZ, late s, opens the door and finds BOURNE. A long look between them -- like two lost brothers who recognize each other -- each has been waiting for this moment for a long time. Martin looks out the window. Where is my sister? She\\'s dead. She was killed. I knew it was going to end this way. It was always going to end this way... I didn\\'t believe that. Why did she die? She was shot. A man came for me. And then you killed him. Bourne nods. Now what? Someone started all this...and I\\'m going to find them. Bourne looks at him for a beat and leaves. Bourne climbs the stairs. Bourne rounds a corner and stops, sees a bodyguard at a door up the street hail a car then go back inside. Bourne walks up to the door, the bodyguard comes out again. Bourne knocks him aside. Grabs the man behind him, Who started Treadstone? The bodyguard comes back, gun out-- (in French, to bodyguard) It\\'s OK! (in French, to Bourne) They\\'re still looking for you. You are taking a big risk coming here. Bourne shoves him against the wall, hard. Just tell me what I want to know! I just provided them weapons.    I don\\'t know who started-- You know something.   Tell me where to start looking. There\\'s a journalist in London. Simon Ross. He seems to know a lot about you.   He has a source inside the program. Someone there from the beginning. What should I tell them if they contact me? They give me the name I want, or I burn their entire house down to get it. ROSS hurries to catch a TAXI as he talks on his cell phone. ...This is big -- a skein of lies -- you pull at it and it just keeps coming -- I\\'ll fill you in when I get home. And it\\'s not finished, either. They\\'re calling it `Blackbriar\\'. \"Blackbriar\" echelon hit. NSA, please confirm receipt. Sir, we intercepted a call from London, keyword \"Blackbriar.\" Okay, send it to CRI right now. We tracked the phone. Registered to a London reporter named Simon Ross. He works at the Guardian newspaper. You tracking him? Yeah, thanks Mike. We have a survey team covering him at work...and a sneak and peek\\'s on their way to his apartment. Well, who talked to him? How did he find out about Blackbriar? We don\\'t know, we pulled his background and ran a cross check on any known anomalies, but we\\'ve come up with nothing. But, I think if we follow Ross, we are going to be able... Right. Ross is easy. I want the source. A   INT. DAY. CRI DATA ROOM (was E)                          A Have you heard of an Operation Blackbriar? I\\'m going to try and get my head around this, see you first thing. Is that all? Yeah. I want rendition protocols and I want the asset put on standby, just in case. People, listen up, this is a full priority situation Jimmy, give me Ross\\'s profile on one. (points at the big screen on the wall) Our target is a British national, Simon Ross, a reporter. I want all his phones, his blackberry, his apartment, his car, bank accounts, credit cards, travel patterns...I want to know what he\\'s going to think before he does. Every dirty little secret he has. And most of all, we want the name and real time location of his source. This is NSA priority level , any questions? All right, let\\'s get to it. Copy that. Mr. Vosen, subject is entering his office. Where\\'s my picture please? Coming online...Online...Now. Take an hour to get his phone... That\\'s too long. So how do we know he\\'s not spinning for someone? There\\'s more. He was scared. Scared of what? Blackbriar. Sorry, a call for you. Who is it? Won\\'t give hie name. He\\'s on my line... Ross (CONT\\'D) Simon Ross. Why aren\\'t we hearing this? That\\'s a hard line, Jimmy, why don\\'t we have it? We have his line, sir, but he\\'s not on it. Waterloo Station, south entrance, thirty minutes. Who is this? This is Jason Bourne. Bourne You want to talk to me. Come alone. Are you getting an image? Where\\'s he going? Okay, he is on the move.   Target is mobile. Okay, people, look sharp, give me eyeballs on the street. Subject is on the move. Go mobile One and Two. Where\\'s that audio on the street? I want to know where he\\'s going... We have the subject confirmed. Where is he heading? Waterloo Station. Stand by at Waterloo... Mobile One -- give us eyes on the subject. Sir, subject just arrived at the south entrance to Waterloo Station. Hello? Don\\'t ask questions. Just listen... What\\'s he doing? I thought we blocked his cell? Who the hell is he talking to??? Jimmy, I need that phone! Activate the asset. Sir, we haven\\'t yet become operational -- I said activate the asset.   I want options. What\\'s the ROE on this one? To your left. Blue hooded top. Walking towards the bus stop BOURNE (o.s.) (CONT\\'D) Go to the bus stop, sit next to him. Head down... Target is on the move. Okay, who\\'s the guy in the blue hood? Okay, there, he\\'s talking to the guy with the hood. Take them down. Watch that bus! The bus! -- don\\'t lose them! Stay triangular and don\\'t get blocked. Grab Team B. Grab the hoody and stay with Ross... Take the footbridge. Go to the West Entrance. I\\'ll meet you at the newsstand. No, no, look...Ross is not on the bus.   Split up the team -- get the guy on the bus and send someone to stay on Ross. You. On the floor. Down. Driver, stop the bus! We\\'ve lost signal. What happened to Survey One? I don\\'t like this. Patch me through to Met surveillance. Why do you know so much about me? What? The article. You talked to someone from Treadstone. Someone there at the beginning.  What\\'s his name? I can\\'t tell you that.... Who\\'s following me? Whoever they are it\\'s trouble. Are they Blackbriar? Blackbriar, what\\'s Blackbriar? I don\\'t know. I heard the name this morning for the first time. Whatever it is, my source said it started with you. What? What are you talking about? Look, just help me get away from these people...and we can talk more...we can-- (spotting approaching operatives) We have to move. Bourne moves Ross toward the concourse. Answer your phone. SCREENS coming alive again. They are through to MET SURVEILLANCE -- the AREA around WATERLOO. Last sighted heading to the West entrance. He\\'s got to be close. Seal the entrances. The new SURVEY team moves towards different entrances -- Ready to beat out the quarry. CAMERAS suddenly alive.   Movement across the footbridge. The net\\'s been thrown. Into the station concourse. ROSS moving fast. Fighting through the crowds of faces. Each one a killer in ROSS\\' tormented mind. BOURNE on the periphery looking out across the throng, picking out the inconsistencies. Three o\\'clock. Female. Blonde black top. Has she seen me? Not yet. Dip left past the photo kiosk. Straight ahead. News kiosk. Change of plan. Stop. Tie your shoelace. Are we clear? Clear. News kiosk. Straight ahead. Straight toward me.     Bin man? Negative. He\\'s got a gun. Negative.    Keep straight ahead. We got a hit. Middle of the concourse. We\\'re losing him! We cannot afford to lose him! Waterloo concourse. Subject heading east. Get into cover. Now! H             What\\'s the status of the asset?                     H In place in one minute. Alright, I want to take him now. Get him out of there and have the asset cover it. Target moving towards the stores. Asset in play. ETA thirty seconds. All exits covered. Through a subterranean maze of corridors. Up steps. Keep moving... Faster.... The front... Suddenly -- CLICK -- PLATFORM  displays. A wave of commuters flooding away -- sweeping the AGENTS back with them towards platform . BOURNE\\'S bought them thirty seconds. PAZ on the move. Earpiece crackling. Through a door. Taking a left down another tunnel. Opens another security door and moves up some steps. Towards a ladder. The AGENTS regrouping. Speaking into their radios. Voice He\\'s in the store -- still moving east. ROSS out into the open again. In front of him another STORE BOURNE searching the concourse. Something bothering him. The threat level clicking another notch. PAZ heads up some stairs to a service platform. Climbs a ladder. ROSS into the store complex. To one side is a service doorway. BOURNE sees the AGENTS approaching. Looks the other way -- up at the hoardings above. Something\\'s not right. Treadstone instinct. Service doorway -- Now! An image of Ross as he enters the store complex appears on the screen. Store.   Three means of egress. Close him down... ROSS through narrow store corridors. Sheer panic now. Two of the AGENTS move in after him. BOURNE behind them. BANG - takes the first out silently. Keep moving. ROSS moving out to the light as another AGENT follows. Through the store room. ROSS travelling through.   The second AGENT right behind as- BOURNE steps out from behind the store room door. The dull snap of bones as second AGENT falls to the floor. On a screen VOSEN watches, transfixed, as BOURNE takes out all his agents and then grabs ROBB... Jesus Christ, that\\'s Jason Bourne. Maybe he\\'s the source? It doesn\\'t matter, the asset now has  targets. Take them both out. WILLS taps in the order... PAZ moves cross a narrow walkway. Now he\\'s behind a mechanical \\'tri-panel\\' hoarding. The kind that displays a different advert every  seconds. He waits for the change and then--- -- A huge field of vision across the concourse stretching out down below him- a sniper\\'s heaven. PAZ pulling open the motor-casing from the side panel, goes to work on it. Slowing the rotation. Rearranging the large triangular prisms to give him just the right time-gap to pull the trigger- and just enough cover to disappear. He takes out rifle parts from his rucksack. Starts to assemble them. I\\'m going to get you to safety but you have to stay calm do exactly what I say. (fear-induced autopilot) Sure, okay. No, listen to me: Exactly what I say this time. Understand? Ross snaps to focus.     Looks Bourne in the eye. Yes. Stay here while I look for an escape. Ross nods. PAZ puts together the rifle. BOURNE exits from the silver door behind Threshers.    He stays on the phone with Ross. Hidden from the view of the CCTV cameras by the thick crowd, Bourne sees the approaching agents abruptly pulling back. I can see the entrance from here I can make it out-- No, stay behind that door. There. That silver door. Bourne\\'s behind that door? Confirmed. Okay, pull the agents back and give Bourne\\'s location to the asset. If I run now I can make it-- No.   Something\\'s not right. The door comes open slightly, but from this angle Paz doesn\\'t have a clean shot at his target (who he thinks is Bourne). Bourne searches the rafters, looking for any threats from above. I\\'m going to go for it, okay? Don\\'t move until I tell you. Bourne is distracted by the last of the agents disappearing. Something is definitely wrong-- I\\'m going to go for it. No, No not now. Ross suddenly sprints out from behind the door-- Paz sees the shape emerge-- PAZ fires-- But it\\'s Ross, not Bourne. Ross is hit by Paz\\'s shot.    He falls, inches from the silver door, dead. Blood has splattered on the door. Paz snaps his head back to the scope, realizing he\\'s shot the wrong person. Then he catches a glimpse of Bourne-- Bourne ducks behind the gathering crowd, out of Paz\\'s line of sight, and goes to the body. Vosen and Wills stare at the screen. At the image of Ross, dead on the concourse.   The room -- normally full of chatter has gone dead silent... Vosen puts his head in his hands. This is a monumental screw up and everyone here knows it.  He just had the wrong man killed.... Oh...shit... Then suddenly Vosen snaps back to focus: Get the asset out of there ... What about Bourne? On the HUB MONITORS we see Police moving in... Vosen doesn\\'t need to see anymore. Get him out of there - NOW! Bourne feels Ross\\' body for something. Paz is frustrated by the order. He\\'s itching to get another shot off at Bourne, but after a beat, packs up quickly, as ordered. Back in Waterloo, Cops run in from all sides. On the screens and in real life, the aftermath of the hit. PARAMEDICS try helplessly to deal with ROSS -- killed instantly by the head shot meant for BOURNE...POLICE arrive and seal off the crime scene... BOURNE on the move. Fast -- Past platforms. On his way up to the Tri Panel. Up stairs. On to a walkway.   To his right he sees a figure disappearing... BOURNE hammers down the walk - way in pursuit. BOURNE tailing PAZ down on to a parallel platform. PAZ dipping down into the underground entrance. PAZ moving deliberately through the evening rush hour-- blending in... BOURNE in pursuit. Chasing on instinct. There...A glimpse of PAZ at the bottom of an escalator. BOURNE fights past people. PAZ disappears into the crowd. BOURNE rushes to catch him. Rounding a corner... A long walkway -- at the end, two staircases lead to different tube lines. BOURNE hesitates-- measures the choice. The sound of a train fills the station-- BOURNE -- Fast downstairs. Watches-- just as PAZ gets onto the car at another door. BOURNE lunges to get on the train...But the doors close... Watching PAZ from the platform as he SAGS down onto a seat, nauseated, his skin clammy, his head pounding...He takes out the PILLS and dry-swallows them...Looks up... Watching PAZ...As if he\\'s looking in the MIRROR at his old self...The self before THE BOURNE IDENTITY... He looks straight ahead, just another commuter... Watching PAZ, as the train pulls away...Then BOURNE is immediately in motion... Hello. It\\'s Vosen. We have a situation. Establishing Sewell and Marbury. DANIELS watches news of ROSS murder on TV. DANIELS panics, opens his safe, packs up papers, takes Blackbriar FILE. Sets alarm. Leaves. BOURNE sits at a computer, the ROSS notebook open in front of him. He pages through it, finding names, places, \"HOW DID THIS ALL START?\" -- and Blackbriar.   He Googles \"Sewell and Marbury\"-- finds Paris, Berlin, Madrid. BOURNE continues to search and finds receipt from Madrid. BOURNE leaves. LANDY steps out of a TAXI... Vosen\\'s sitting. Sparkling. And a \"Heart-Healthy\" omelet with goat cheese and peppers. Landy arrives. You\\'re late. Traffic? Ma\\'am? Nothing for me. Vosen looks at her, surprised. I\\'m buying. She shakes her head, no. She sits, without taking her coat off. She\\'s not staying long. When the Director called, it was suggested we bring you on-- Suggested? Are you sure it was just a suggestion? Funny how different things look depending on where you sit. I look at this as doing a favor for you. Giving you an opportunity to complete some unfinished business. Meaning? Jason Bourne. Bourne\\'s finished. Really? It was finished the moment I realized I was chasing him for something he didn\\'t do.   The case is closed. So what do you make of this? (handing her surveillance photos of Bourne in Paris) French intel picked up Bourne meeting Pierre Elattrache on Tuesday. He threatened to burn our house down if you didn\\'t tell him who started Treadstone. That\\'s a big problem, wouldn\\'t you agree? This doesn\\'t feel like Bourne to me. Why\\'s it so hard for you to believe? Probably because it\\'s coming from you, Noah. Lets try and be adults okay? We all thought he was done, off the grid. But Bourne\\'s back. Maybe he\\'s a threat. We both want the same thing here. So what happened at Waterloo? We have a leak. Bourne showed up in our surveillance. We had very little time to react. And the reporter ended up dead? Bourne saw us coming. Landy looks at him, suspicious. So what was he doing? We don\\'t know. But just the fact that he was there means he\\'s up to something, don\\'t you think? Maybe he\\'s the source? The real question is how you managed to get in a fire fight in the middle of a public train station. Don\\'t second guess an operation from an armchair, Pam. It\\'s not fair. I\\'m going to the office now. I\\'ll make my own introductions. Off VOSEN... AN AVE train pulling into the vast station. BOURNE stepping out, walking up the platform. Moving out through the station... TWO NEW TECHS plus the three we met before.       All watching VOSEN lead LANDY and CRONIN into the room. This is Pamela Landy. She\\'s gonna be quarterbacking our search effort. I think what we oughta do, just to get started, let\\'s go around the room, say who you are and what your spec is. LANDY stepping in before this gets going -- Let\\'s do names later. (she\\'s got the floor) What\\'s Bourne\\'s last fixed position? Anybody. London.   Twelve hundred Zulu. Status?   Wounded?   Armed? Alive.    Mobile. Unknown. Where are your grids coming from? NSA Tactical. You have an Echelon package? Yes. Why isn\\'t it on? We were waiting. For what? You\\'re nine hours behind the toughest target you\\'ve ever tracked. I want everyone to sit down, strap in, and turn on all you\\'ve got. That would mean now. That lights it.    They\\'re moving. Thank you. VOSEN watches... I want everything you\\'ve got on Ross on screen one. LANDY watches as the screen lights up with ROSS information... Bourne arrives, begins to recon the area. He goes to the front door finds \"Sewell and Marbury\" and rings the bell. No answer. Two cops come around a corner. Bourne sees them, notes the side of the building and leaves. Sir, we just hacked Ross\\'s email account at the Guardian and found a round trip ticket to Turin, yesterday.  arrival, : departure. I think we can be pretty certain that Bourne\\'s not your source then? How? Ross\\'s call to his editor, where he said he just met the source on Blackbriar, took place just after his flight landed. His met his source in Turin. So? So, what, Bourne met Ross for breakfast and then, at noon the same day Bourne calls Ross to demand a meet at Waterloo? Maybe they were even on the same flight? Cross check the secure cell phone usage of everyone with Blackbriar SCI clearance against all calls in and out of Turin during the morning Ross was there TECHNICIANS start pounding keyboards. The guy you\\'re after is a CIA operative with clearance above Top Secret.   He was committing treason by talking to Ross.   Do you really think, while doing that, he used a cell phone he knows we can track? Zero results on the cross check. VOSEN stares daggers at her. Do you have a better idea? Yeah, I\\'d look at all the people whose cell phones were switched off the entire period Ross was in Turin. Do it Jimmy. TECHNICIANS start tapping. I mean if your people use their cell phones as much as mine do, the list should be pretty small Three names: Tom Brewster, Jack Boulin, Neal Daniels. The names display on the screen:   Tom Brewster, Jack Boulin Neal Daniels. The HUB employees can\\'t help but be impressed by LANDY. WILLS and VOSEN notice their response. Now check everything in Ross\\'s apartment against those names. Look for common patterns, look for - Initials .....Bring that up on main. LANDY turns.   CRONIN is leaning down in front of a computer screen.   Point to something for the tech --- who puts it on the big screen, blown up. In a set of handwritten notes by ROSS it says \"per N.D.\"next to several scrawls. Neal Daniels.   He\\'s Station Chief in Madrid now, isn\\'t he? Jesus Christ. Call the RSO at the Embassy and have them take Daniels into custody if he\\'s there.   If he\\'s not, get a grab team to the Calle Norte safe house. Send them in heavy and tell them we\\'ll assist with entry. \"Heavy?\" Daniels isn\\'t-- I\\'m worried about Bourne. If he\\'s not Ross\\'s source, then he must be after Ross\\'s source -- just like us. Off LANDY... BOURNE in a TAXI turning a corner into a narrow street. The rain has slowed, but the streets are still quiet. BOURNE gets out and walks past the SEWELL and MARBURY front door, picks the lock and gains entry. BOURNE up the stairs.   Finds the office.    Jimmies the door. Disables the alarm. All the signs of a hurried exit. A half filled cup of coffee -- cigarette burned down in an ashtray but not snubbed out -- a light left on -- files and documents, some shredded, some not. Vosen paces back and forth. The hub is MUCH quieter than it was in the Waterloo scenes. Parque Vasquez is clean. No sign of subject. Team two, ETA Callee Norte? Three minutes. A BLACK CAR moving briskly through traffic and -- HAMMOND at the wheel.   KILEY with the map. Shutting off his phone. BOURNE checks the office.   Soon he finds a photo of Daniels with Albert Hirsch. Bourne arrives at a nondescript steel door with two CCTV cameras covering it. He sees  written above the door. The flashback overwhelms Bourne. POV shots of Bourne walking down the long corridor with Daniels. Other shots revealing that Bourne is in Army dress greens (without hat). Daniels knocks and leads Bourne into- - Bourne is driven to his knees. Bourne is dragged into a room with a large water tank. His hands have been bound behind his back, the sack\\'s drawstring pulled tight, and he has been weighted down. Bourne is shoved into the water. Bourne falls into the water. SPLASH. He starts to sink. The wet sack allows us to see the outlines of his face. Also POVs as Bourne sinks. Bourne struggles wildly at first. Tries to get out of his restraints. But to no avail. SRD men watch him from the edge of the tank. Perhaps also on monitors. Expressionless. Bourne fights every human instinct to draw a breath.    Also shot from Bourne\\'s POV: You\\'re going to drown. There is nothing you can do to prevent this. Stop struggling and accept it. Finally Bourne can\\'t hold his breath for an instant longer. His mouth opens. Water rushes in. He convulses, begins to drown... Bourne\\'s body goes limp.   SRD men watch.   No reaction. Bourne goes limp.   POV of him blacking out. BOURNE comes out of the FLASHBACK. As he staggers across the room, he notices a car arriving on the monitor... A car approaches. Bourne snaps out of it and sees the car on a security monitor. Agents get out of car and approach building. Sir, they\\'re at the front door. VOSEN watches... HAMMOND AND KILEY enter the building. BOURNE runs water into the TEA KETTLE -- sets the trap... HAMMOND and KILEY enter. We\\'re in. BOURNE listens from his hiding spot. LANDY paces. Okay, put it live. HAMMOND moves quickly into the room -- gun raised. HAMMOND at the alarm box. Alarm\\'s down. That has to be Bourne. VOSEN already moving to the monitor. HAMMOND and KILEY -- move cautiously from room to room -- they\\'ve done it before... Safe\\'s cleaned out. VOSEN pacing impatiently around the speakerphone -- Shit...    Track the passports. KILEY gestures to a light moving under a door. Kiley crouching...leaning in...hand on the knob, and -- Pulls the closet DOOR OPEN -- Nothing. Sink, dishes. a small kitchen.         And... on the stove...a tea kettle and a spoon... Which is the last thing they\\'ll remember, because... BOURNE -- coming around the corner fast -- full stop and -- BOURNE lays out HAMMOND... KILEY turns to find BOURNE -- who takes him out too. Then it stops. BOURNE yanks the headsets.       Closes the PHONE. The SCREENS go black.       Silence... Goddamn it! Get a back-up team in there! TEA KETTLE payoff... How long till back-up arrives? The hub scrambles to answer that...       Landy paces in the background. Suspicious of Vosen... How long? (beat, loud, to the entire hub) Stop! Hang on. I have an idea... ON A SECURITY MONITOR -- BOURNE sees another figure moving up the stairs...Checking his watch, reloading his gun. Twisting into the path to shoot as the door opens, hesitating because- It\\'s NICKY. A beat -- long unbroken. What are you doing here? I was posted here after Berlin. Where\\'s Daniels? The office PHONE goes. Bourne waving her to it.   She picks it up. He hits the speaker phone. Hello. Who is this? This is Nicky Parsons. Who\\'s this? Landy reacts to her voice... Both Vosen and Landy strongly suspect Bourne is there and listening... Vosen reads her \"Duress Challenge\" identity check off the screen. It reads: Challenge:    \"Sparrow\" Response if Under Duress:       \"Ruby\" Response if Normal:    \"Everest\" Nicky, I need to do an ID challenge first. Code in: \"Sparrow.\" Vosen looks at the screen to check her response... Response: \"Everest\". Nicky, this is Noah Vosen. How long have you been on site? I just walked in. We have two officers on site. Are you in contact with them? They\\'re down. Unconscious, but alive. Is there any sign of Daniels? No. Nicky, this is Pam Landy. We have reason to believe there is a connection between Neal Daniels and Jason Bourne. Bourne, are you still looking for Bourne? I thought the case was closed. No, some people are convinced he\\'s still a threat. I disagree but to find out I need to talk to him. VOSEN seething because LANDY has interrupted him... Hold on Nicky. Vosen hits the mute button. What are you doing? You know Bourne\\'s probably listening. Landy doesn\\'t answer.    Vosen to Wills: How long till back up arrives. Wills holds up three fingers.      Vosen unmutes. Listen, Nicky. I want you to stay put and secure the premises. It could be an hour until another team arrives. LANDY piercing VOSEN with a look... BOURNE continues to hold the gun in her face -- NICKY is very calm considering the predicament she is in. Okay. DIAL TONE as the line gets closed at the other end. They know you\\'re here. How long do I have? Three minutes... FLASH: TWO SEDANS squeal around a corner.      CRI reinforcements. minutes to safehouse. My car\\'s outside.    I know where Daniels is. BOURNE lowers his gun, grabs the phone and dials \"--\" Emergency operator. Where is your emergency? BOURNE answers her in perfect Spanish with a perfect Madrid accent, but worked up, like a civilian would be... Calle Norte. I hear gunfire. And men shouting. I think they\\'re Americans -- BOURNE pushes the phone off the desk -- fires four shots into the ceiling -- calmly moves Nicky towards the back door... You \"disagree\" he\\'s a threat? He just took out two more of my men. Not to mention his ultimatum to Ellatrache? The only way this has a happy ending, Noah, is if we find a way to bring Bourne in voluntarily. He wants revenge, Pam. The only realistic way to deal with this is to eliminate the threat. BOURNE and NICKY rapidly descend. Okay, where is Daniels headed? o\\'clock this morning, he wired $,. to a numbered bank account in Tangier. Okay, Tangier is about  miles away, we can make the morning ferry. And then what? Bourne and Nicky exit on to the street.     Suddenly they hear tires squealing nearby. They\\'re coming. They continue to walk down the street towards Nicky\\'s car. Vosen and Landy are watching this live. As they cross the street two MADRID POLICE CARS come around the corner the wrong way and screech to a stop. Vosen reacts... Four cops jump out and take aim at the AGENTS. Manos Arriba! Manos Arriba! More sirens closing in.      A third police car appears. Then a fourth... Vosen can\\'t believe it-- The agents drop their guns and surrender. BOURNE and NICKY continue around a corner -- they get in her VW GOLF and drive away... Vosen stares at Landy.    A beat, then she walks out. Issue a standing kill order on Jason Bourne, effective immediately. VOSEN on the phone. We lost Bourne. You still think he\\'s after Daniels? Yeah. Nicky\\'s just the means. But if we find Daniels, we\\'ll find Bourne. Daniels knows way too much. Daniels knows everything. We can\\'t let them meet. I\\'ll take care of it. Good. And fill Hirsch in.     Just in case. BOURNE and NICKY sit over coffee.    A long silence...then: What are you after, Jason?   Why are you looking for Daniels? Do you know who this is? Bourne puts the photo of Daniels and Hirsch on the table between them.    She looks at the photo, points. That\\'s Daniels. I don\\'t know who that is. I have to get back to the beginning...or I\\'ll never be free of this. Who is he? I think he started Treadstone.    I remember meeting him.   I remember the first day... Daniels brought me to him. Nicky looks back at him....not sure what to say. What happened? An initiation...I guess... QUICK FLASH: Bourne, head in sack, is held underwater, struggling desperately for breath-- Bourne comes out of the flashback.      Nicky is looking at him.... Jason...that wasn\\'t some one-off initiation. Daniels said they did that to you over and over again.   That\\'s how they... She doesn\\'t finish.    And Bourne doesn\\'t ask her to.     Just a long pause. Why are you helping me? It was difficult for me...with you. BOURNE looks up.    Another long pause... You really don\\'t remember anything? No. NICKY\\'S face. Two SPANISH COPS enter the cafe. We should move. They get up and leave... Vosen goes to his safe. Noah Vosen. Then he puts his thumb into a print reader. The safe door pops open. He pulls out a file marked \"Top Secret.\" CRONIN makes his way down the hallway. LANDY works at her desk.       CRONIN enters... They tracked Daniels\\' passport to a hotel in Tangier. They\\'re holding up a bank transfer he made to keep him in place while they move an asset in from Casablanca. Off LANDY.    This just keeps getting worse... Landy enters without knocking. Since when do you have authorization for lethal action against Daniels? Since he cleaned out a Blackbriar safe and fled to Morocco! So grab him-- I don\\'t have the people on the ground to do that and I\\'m not going to risk that file falling into the wrong hands. What\\'s going on?    What\\'s Daniels got? What\\'s he got? He ran all of Blackbriar\\'s operations in Southern Europe and North Africa. I think the world\\'s well aware we have a rendition and lethal action capability at this point, Noah. For Christ\\'s sake, Pam, he\\'s got our entire playbook. Names, dates, ghost sites, how we train our assets..... You still don\\'t have the authority to kill him. Oh, yes I do, Pam. That\\'s what makes us special. No red tape. No more getting badguys in our sights and then watching them escape while we wait for some bureaucrat to issue the order. You just decide? No oversight. No checks and balances. Come on, Pam, you\\'ve seen the raw intel. You know how real the threat is.    We can\\'t afford to have our hands tied like that anymore. They arrive and pass through CUSTOMS... DANIELS drives... DESH arrives, grabs a TAXI... BOURNE and NICKY enter a shabby room. Turn on the fluorescent lights... BOURNE tosses his BACKPACK on the bed... NICKY plugs her LAPTOP into the USB port... ON THE SCREEN, as NICKY hacks into the system... Landy on the phone. It\\'s Pamela Landy for him. Would you tell him it\\'s urgent? The phone buzzes.   Kramer picks it up. It\\'s Pam Landy. She says it\\'s urgent. On Kramer...the wheels turning.... Tell her I\\'m unreachable. Kramer hangs up. Landy receives the news.... The wheels turning in her head.... She hangs up.    A pensive moment, then she gets up and heads for-- LANDY AND CRONIN enter the hub-- VOSEN is in the middle of giving the kill order. Give me the subject\\'s location. Subject is currently on foot and now entering Hotel Velazquez. Route Commerce, Tangier. Get an elevation and a floor plan, tic-tac-toe. Locate the room. Give the asset Daniels\\'s location and the route between Daniel\\'s hotel and the bank. DESH looks down at his beeping cellphone.      It has a MAP on the screen. Nicky at her computer. Bourne looks on. Vosen and Wills.    Landy still pacing Do we have that room yet? Yes sir Room . Get the hotel\\'s trunk line. Run all calls through here with an iso on Sir, the asset is acquiring the materials. DESH opens a lock-up and goes in. He comes out with a scooter and drives off. Nicky types on computer.    Enters search parameter: NEAL His location\\'s being blocked. Now they found Daniels, do you know where he is? They\\'ll get one of the operatives to terminate him. Find out who. Desh works on a bomb. Desh. DESH BOUKSANI\\'s profile. Tell him you\\'re going to meet him and that you have a new phone for him. If you stop Desh they\\'ll just get someone else. We\\'re not going to stop him. We\\'re going to follow him. He\\'ll take us right to Daniels. \"Meet me Tangier Cafe Paris\" The bomb is finished on the Work table. Desh takes the scooter out. Bourne and Nicky walk. Desh rides his scooter. Sir, the asset is deviating. Find out why. BOURNE, recalculating. Looking around him. A scooter is pulling up and the driver walks toward BOURNE. Asset unscheduled stop. NICKY SITS, Desh walks up and snatches the phone off of the table. A scooter is pulling up and the driver walks toward BOURNE. He brushes past him, taking the key. Keeping DESH in sight as he returns to his Vespa and pulls out in to traffic. Sir, the asset is on the move, in route to subject. Sir, the asset is back on course. VOSEN looks up. Sir, we have an unauthorized breach. Someone with active system knowledge has penetrated out protocols. Information was passed to the asset at .. The trace is confirmed and valid. It comes from a computer belonging to Nicky Parsons. VOSEN looks over at Landy....his wheels turning.   A series of cuts between them. Where did the course deviation occur? South to Rue Belgique. Stationery at Place de France. That\\'s where Parson\\'s is. He pauses, deciding what course to take.    Landy watches. When we\\'re finished with Daniels send the asset after her. We find Parsons, we find Bourne. (going to Vosen, firm) Noah, what are you doing? Not now. Now.   I want to know what\\'s going on. Not now. I\\'m asking on what basis you\\'re continuing this operation. On the basis that Nicky Parsons has compromised a covert operation. She is up to her neck in it. This is about Daniels, not Nicky! She has betrayed us! You don\\'t know the circumstances! She\\'s in league with Jason Bourne for Chrissake! You don\\'t have the authority to kill her or Bourne! Yes, I do Pam, it\\'s right here and it\\'s legal. VOSEN slams a document on the desk.   INSERT SHOT: \"Blackbriar: Lethal Action Protocol.\" She\\'s one of our own.   You start down this path...where does it end?! It ends when we\\'ve won. LANDY turns and storms out... Notify the asset of the additional target. Yes, sir. BRYAN codes in a kill order on NICKY... As he rides his VESPA, DESH receives additional target information..Pictures of BOURNE and NICKY. DESH glances in his rearview mirror -- spots BOURNE. Have the bank release the funds. A TECH calls DANIELS. DANIELS answers phone. Mr. Daniels, Bank of Tangier. Your funds are now available. Daniels leaves. DESH parks the motorbike and walks around the corner, BOURNE follows. DANIELS\\' car coming down the street.     BOURNE stops and sees the car -- realizes the danger. BOURNE turns back to see DESH with the detonator in his hand. BOURNE locks eyes with DESH.      Before BOURNE can react -- DESH detonates. BOOM! DANIELS is DEAD. BOURNE is thrown across the street by the blast.     He lays DESH POV. He looks back to see BOURNE not moving, lying in the street. DESH gets on his motorbike and heads off to kill NICKY. NICKY still at that cafe waiting. Taking out her phone-        * puzzled.                                                       * She answers. Looking around.                                   * Code in?                                            * Code in?                                            * Nothing. Just the noise of traffic.                            * DESH on the move towards Petit Socco. On the cell - making     * that \\'silent call\\'.                                            * BOURNE\\'S too late- hearing the \\'line busy\\' tone.

A screen comes alive.                        * We have a trace.                                    * Target heading north. Rue des                       * Chretiens. Intercept ETA six                        * minutes.                                            * Okay, that\\'s it.    Bar her cell.                   * Tie it off.                                         * DESH is disappearing from view.                                * And the POLICEMEN are surrounding BOURNE.

Through the crowds into the traffic.     * Police whistles- shouting. Confusion.                        * The chase is on.                                             * Three policemen turning into his path. No choice. BOURNE     * taking them down.

Answering.                          * Bourne?                                           * Nicky?    Listen to me.

The sound of POLICE getting nearer.             * BOURNE hearing the POLICE too as he moves up onto a              * landing.                                                         * * BOURNE into a main room - something stirring on a couch - a      * girl and her little sister having a siesta.                      * In another room two small boys fast asleep.    TV playing.       * One wakes.                                                       * A noise on the stairs above. Quickly arranging a mirror -        * getting line of sight - Bourne dipping into a corner.            * It\\'s NICKY.                                                      * She gives him a look -- DESH is in here somewhere.               * The door goes below them.   The noise of Police entering the   * Riad.                                                          * NICKY signalling to BOURNE - this way.                         * They climb narrow stairs to the next floor.                    * Down below Police begin searching rooms. Waking the            * sleeping family. Shouting, crying. Commotion.                  * BOURNE and NICKY creeping up the steps.                        * Then - suddenly NICKY spinning round as two silenced           * bullets speed past her - And DESH bursting out of a landing    * toilet.                                                        * On to Bourne.                                                  * Full on Treadstone fighting in the narrow stairwell.           * Crashing into a tiny disused lift cage- silent constrained-    * vicious.                                                       * Downstairs a young POLICEMAN hears the noise- heading for      * the lift.                                                      * NICKY seeing the handle turn. Thinking quickly.   She sends    * the lift up to the next floor.                                 * The POLICEMAN stepping back from the door -- directing the     * other cops out to the courtyard.                               * People are spilling out into the atrium.   It\\'s pandemonium.   * Bourne and Desh spill out of the elevator and onto the         * roof.                                                          * BOURNE kicking the gun - spinning across the floor - he and    * DESH facing each other.                                        * DESH with BOURNE - straight over the edge.                     * DESH still on top - just.                                      * A brutal exchange. Matching each other\\'s moves like            * shadows.                                                       * Relentless. Rolling - falling onto another roof level.         * And another.                                                   * The two men tiring now. DESH grabbing for the bag.     The            * pills. BOURNE kicking them away.                                      * BOURNE has the upper hand now.      DESH\\'S reaction\\'s slowing.        * No longer the match he was.                                           * BOURNE drags him to the ground.     He\\'s finished.   Bourne\\'s         * won.                                                                  * DESH- shivering -- convulsing.                                        * In the struggle, BOURNE strangles Desh. BOURNE and NICKY hide DESH\\'s body. Alright, we need to be dead.    You need to code that in. NICKY CODES into DESH\\'S PDA -- BOTH OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED...In the CRI HUB the message comes up...VOSEN and LANDY believe NICKY and BOURNE are both DEAD... The code from DESH remains on screen -- BOTH OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED -- like an EPITAPH for BOURNE and NICKY...VOSEN packs his briefcase. Turns to WILLS. I want to be sure. Have the station chief in Rabat confirm the deaths and do a sub-rosa check...And keep and eye on Landy. Off WILLS... Cronin enters. The hub just got word Bourne and Nicky are dead. Landy looks at him. Confirmed? Not yet. Landy looks away...thinking.      Wheels turning. Get me a copy of Bourne\\'s personnel file. Bourne and Nicky enter. BOURNE scrubs the blood from his hands.    REVEAL Nicky watching him from the bedroom. Landy sits at her desk reviewing files on Treadstone. Open on her desk we see the file she will be looking at in the Supremacy phone call. The way she examines the papers we get the sense she thinks something is missing, some piece, some file. Bourne scrubbing the blood from his hands. Nicky comes in, touches his shoulder. There\\'s a tenderness to it, a re- assurance. For a moment it looks like Bourne might react...but the moment passes.... Landy opens a new file.   Bourne\\'s operations. Bourne is toweling off. I can see all their faces. But I can\\'t remember any names.... Landy looks at Bourne\\'s kills. The faces Bourne remembers. But there names are here, and who they were, why they were killed. Bourne and Nicky sitting together. I was starting to remember who they were...in India...with Marie. A beat. It\\'s just going to lead to more killing, Jason. Are you sure you want that? Bourne takes her words in.    But who he is is eating him alive from the inside... I\\'ve killed people and I\\'ve tried to apologize for what I\\'ve done, for what I am. None of it makes it better... Another moment passes between them...then: They\\'re going to come for you again. You are going to have to run now. She gets up. Nicky dies her hair BLACK.    Starts cutting it shorter. Bourne walks with a now dark-haired Nicky. They exchange looks for a long beat. She turns towards the bus. It gets easier. Landy finds a denotation in Bourne\\'s file that he was \"recruited to Treadstone by Neal Daniels.\"   Further down the   page it says \"Bourne was inducted into Treadstone at the Special Research Department facility at  E st, New York, NY.\"    Then \"Facility closed by order of Director, June .\" Bourne looks at the tattered remains of Daniels\\' body and belongings. He goes through his briefcase and finds a nearly destroyed piece of paper with \"Noah Vosen - Director of Operations - CRI\" written on it. Bourne slips the morgue attendant a bribe. Vosen is shaving. Station chief in Rabat just called, they found a body. Bourne? Desh. On final approach to JFK. Bourne looks out the window to see the Verizano Narrows bridge.   And beyond it, Manhattan.   Bourne is coming home. Establishes skyline. Pam, You need to see this. Landy follows CRONIN into-- BOURNE\\'S PASSPORT is displayed on the computer monitor. This passport just cleared Immigration at JFK ten minutes ago. It\\'s an early Treadstone identity registered to Jason Bourne but he never used it and it never went to the grid. Bourne\\'s alive. They don\\'t know. No, if they knew Vosen wouldn\\'t be in his office right now. Bourne moves through the airport. It\\'s a hell of a risk. Yeah. Maybe Bourne wants us to know, just like Naples, maybe he\\'s communicating. Maybe he\\'s trying to communicate with you. Maybe we should communicate back. Because I think I know what Bourne\\'s looking for. Bourne over the th Street Bridge -- arrives at CRI -- goes into the adjacent building -- Bourne uses his monocular to zoom in on a file Vosen is looking at -- he sees the word \"Blackbriar.\" Vosen puts the file back in the safe. LANDY\\'S cell phone rings.   She answers it. Pamela Landy. I hear you\\'re still looking for me. LANDY puts down her pencil.   CRONIN watches. Bourne? Get in here! Bourne called Landy! I guess I owe you an apology. Is that official? Are we triangulating?! No. Off the record. You know how it is. Trying-- Good-bye. Wait.     Wait. David Webb. That\\'s your real name. Why the hell did she give him that? You were born // in Nixa, Missouri. Why don\\'t you come in, and we\\'ll talk about it? Bourne? Get some rest, Pam. You look tired. He\\'s got line of sight on us! ...This is a national security emergency. We have an imminent threat. Landy takes out her gun.   Checks it. Jason Bourne is alive and at large in New York City. We believe in one thousand yards of this building. I want an immediate twelve block lockdown of the area. Send a FLASH message to Langley, prep for local backup assistance. HIGH ANGLE:   Landy leaves CRI. Wills walks over to Vosen. The look in his eye indicates that he thinks there\\'s something odd about this: Landy just left the building. Vosen looks at Wills.... A beat, Vosen\\'s suspicion building, though he can\\'t quite put his finger on what he suspects... Check Landy\\'s phone.   Is she using it? Landy receives a text message. Vosen leans in to the Hub\\'s back monitoring room. Nothing?   No calls since Bourne-- ? Wait a minute. Wait. She just got a text. Landy heads for someplace -- now with purpose. VOSEN confers with WILLS. What the hell do you mean we can\\'t read it? Working on it-- How do you know a text came if you can\\'t read it-- Are we on Landy? Six men.   More on the way. I want that goddamn text.   We need to get out in front of her! Seconds... VOSEN paces anxiously. Got it! TECH points at big screen: \"Tudor City Pl & nd.   Ten minutes. Come alone. Come on foot.\" Surround it. Anyone not on Landy goes to Tudor City. Now! Get the trucks. We\\'re going mobile. LANDY walks east toward Tudor City.   She looks around her for any signs of surveillance but finds nothing out of the ordinary. Vosen and AGENTS come running out of the front door. Others leave through a side entrance.   They jump in sedans. Landy still being trailed by foot. Vosen and agents race to Tudor city.   An electronic map on the dash. Copy, we\\'re going to take a left at st. One block, settle at the corner. Get the map up. It\\'s a bad place to pick, it\\'s too exposed. He wouldn\\'t have chosen it if he didn\\'t have a reason. LANDY walks east through the crowded streets. BOURNE walks down the street, enters a building. Spotter on a rooftop. LANDY is on the east side now, walking toward Tudor City. An agents trails her on foot.   Another parallels her from across the street. SERIES OF SHOTS: CRI cars arrive, careful to stay several blocks from the meet site. They jump out and try to set up surreptitious surveillance posts. Okay folks here we go, box at two hundred meters. Let\\'s lock it down. Bourne climbs stairs. Landy walks, agents are everywhere looking for her.   Vosen is still in car. As soon as you have eyes on Landy, I want to know. She becomes clear to AGENT . Okay, here we go. Bourne climbs stairs.   Walks down a dank hallway. Copy that, I see her. Landy stands on a corner waiting for Bourne. Any sign of Bourne? TIGHT SHOT on Bourne\\'s face. FAST TILT to TIGHT ON his hands, pulling up what seems like a piece of clear tape. We can\\'t tell where we are or what he\\'s doing. Landy looks around. TIGHT ON Bourne\\'s hands placing the clear tape on a piece of clear plastic. Again we can\\'t tell what\\'s going on. Agents watch Landy. Vosen\\'s cell phone rings. Noah Vosen. This is Jason Bourne. VOSEN reels for a beat. Then quickly scans the streets, trying to see if he can spot BOURNE. How did you get this number? You didn\\'t actually think I was coming to Tudor City, did you? No, I guess not. But if it\\'s me you want to talk to maybe we can arrange a meet. Where are you right now? In my office. I doubt that. If you were in your office-- REVEAL that BOURNE is inside VOSEN\\'S office. We\\'d be having this conversation face-to-face. BOURNE hangs up. Puts a portable dictaphone up to VOSEN\\'S SAFE and his play: Noah Vosen. As he places the plastic slide we saw in the ECUs into the fingerprint reader. The safe pops open-- VOSEN stunned....     Is it possible?   Is it a trick? From the safe, BOURNE scoops out the \"TREADSTONE: Blackbriar\" folder Bourne saw Vosen putting into his safe.\" He flips it open. He scans down the page.         His eye stopping at the words \"US Citizen.\" He flips to another page -- another photo, and again \"US Citizen.\" BOURNE shoves the folders in his backpack and leaves. This is a code ten abort, I want everybody back in the vehicles this is a code ten abort! Back to the vehicles immediately, back to CRI immediately. Bourne rushes down with his back pack. Wills grabs the phone and hits a speed-dial: Bourne got into your safe! Bourne onto the street with back pack. SERIES OF SHOTS -- VOSEN\\'S SUV races, lights and sirens, across town. ) Other CRI cars race back across town. BOURNE walks out of a building, backpack over his shoulder. BOURNE walks around a corner near CRI. He hears a siren turn on a few blocks away. Then another.   He starts to run. A SEDAN pulls to a stop as a door comes open. CRONIN\\'S inside.   REVEAL Landy on the sidewalk. She jumps in. What just happened? Bourne got into Vosen\\'s safe. What?! Cronin pulls out. Where to? East st Street. Cronin puts it together. .....     Jesus, Pam. BOURNE walking away from CRI. Agents leaving a building.    Getting into unmarked sedans and peeling out. As Vosen races across town. ...I want the entire building searched. Every room. Every hallway. Every closet. Every goddamm airduct. Do you understand? I want him found! The passenger side agent sees BOURNE, points-- BOURNE cuts to the south side of the road so the passenger- side agent doesn\\'t have a shot, while controlling the car makes it almost impossible for the driver to fire accurately. The westbound car cuts sharply and drives up on the sidewalk. But Bourne is too fast. He\\'s already past them. The passenger side agent jumps out. But he\\'s still got to get around the door and then move a few steps to get a bead over the hood of his car on Bourne. The other CRI car races the wrong way on the street but gets immobilized and trapped by the onrushing tunnel traffic. Vosen and Wills race West on st. CRI cars close in -- on nd, on th, on th Ave. Bourne races through the tunnel traffic and onto th street.   He rushes east toward the spaghetti of concrete ramps leading into and out of Port Authority. He runs across th Avenue as a third CRI car screams up the street at him. Several radios blare. He\\'s heading for Port Authority! Subject up the ramp, eastbound into Port Authority. Lethal force is authorized. I told- Tell them again! Bourne runs up a one lane outgoing ramp. The driver pilots his car up the ramp behind Bourne. He jams the accelerator down.   He\\'ll be on top of Bourne -- running him over -- in seconds-- A New Jersey-bound bus exits the complex and heads around the corner of the ramp -- it skids to a stop when it sees Bourne and the CRI car giving chase heading right at the bus. The driver has to skid to a stop to avoid hitting the bus. Bourne slides between the side of the bus and concrete guard rail.   The driver calls it in-- Cops and CRI cars close in on Port Authority.   One agent jumps out of his car on th Avenue and rushes for the stairs. Block every exit. I want a full perimeter on Port Authority-- Box him in! Box him in! He\\'s on the roof.   He\\'s trapped. We\\'ve got him! He\\'s got nowhere to run! Take him out! Ho-ly shit! (practically screaming into his handheld) He did what?! Get down there! Get down! Who has eyeball on him?! Who has eyeball?! One of the agents scrambles over the edge and starts to climb down. Other agents race for the stairs. Don\\'t tell me-- --you\\'ve lost him! Who\\'s on street level?! Street level backup?! Clearly there is no one down there. Bourne\\'s car jump from the roof has completely flat-footed them. Get NYPD backup! And FBI, DEA, any other federal assets we can draft! Two CRI cars race down from the roof to try to get to the level Bourne\\'s on. Bourne cuts off a guy cruising for a parking space and pulls him from his car and races away as the agent from the roof lands hard behind him. Bourne\\'s race to the exit is cut off as a rd CRI sedan slides into view and it\\'s occupants open fire on Bourne in a head on charge. The just stolen vehicle takes heavy fire as Bourne reacts instantaneously; thumbing on the cruise control, shouldering his door open, and slamming the gas pedal to the floor as he dives out of the car. The agents react as Bourne\\'s sedan torpedoes them head on. Hit hard they\\'re taken out of the fight as metal collapses, glass shatters, and airbags explode. Bourne tumbles to a stop at the rear of a parked car as his car implodes against the oncoming agents. Instantly Bourne is on his feet, moving between the parked cars to engage another CRI sedan traveling parallel to the course of the wrecked one. The agents in this sedan are distracted by the still echoing crash and are caught off-guard as Bourne steps out and points his gun at the driver. The driver ducks and floors his gas pedal in a desperate effort to save his own life. As the sedan suddenly accelerates, Bourne deliberately shifts his aim to the sedan\\'s front tire and fires. The tire explodes and the car suddenly veers left and slams into a parked car, pitching the driver violently against the unyielding interior of the sedan. An instant later Bourne rips the radio off the dazed drivers belt just before he cold cocks him with it. With the wreck still echoing through the garage Bourne has to deal with the arrival of the first NYPD sedan. Bourne takes on the persona of an alarmed witness as the on edge cop climbs out of his car but Bourne\\'s performance is cut short as the agent running from his drop from the roof, arrives and opens fire. The police officer goes down in the hail of gunfire as Bourne turns and expertly drops the gunman with a single shot. The increasing volume of squealing tires alerts Bourne to a new threat, he pulls the officer into some cover and grabs the officer\\'s radio. -. Shots fired. Officer down. Port Authority parking lot. Level four. Bourne rips a piece of his sweater off and ties a makeshift tourniquet for the officer.   Then he hands the cop his radio back. Stay out of sight until one of your own arrive. Bourne disappears. We pick him up as he jumps into the cops car and guns the engine and heads for the exits. CRI agents are confused for a second -- until they pick up the NYPD car exiting Port Authority on one of the ramps. But that\\'s all the time Bourne needs-- Bourne turns on his lights and siren and speeds east, followed closely by a CRI sedan. As cars yield to Bourne\\'s siren a taxi tries to jump into Bourne\\'s wake but a CRI sedan punches the taxi back to the right. It ricochets off several parked cars before regaining control. Bourne struggles to keep his over-matched vehicle ahead of the more powerful CRI Sedan which tries to spin Bourne out by hitting his bumper. Bourne tacks right quickly and barely avoids a stopped car. The CRI sedan flanking Bourne\\'s slams into the rear of that car, spinning it  degrees into the path of the trailing CRI sedan which destroys itself in the resulting collision and blocks the path of the other CRI sedan. Bourne is home free. He looks around and spots a sign that indicates a right turn and says \"To Holland Tunnel / US .\" Bourne turns right-- Suddenly the window next to his head explodes as two more shots rip through his door to tear a jagged wound into the top of Bourne\\'s leg. REVEAL Paz, his SUV racing along the curb lane. As Bourne\\'s car crosses in front of a small car stopped at the intersection Paz swerves his car into that car and punches it into the side of Bourne\\'s car. Bourne\\'s car is knocked spinning, Paz keeps charging forward and slams into the back of Bourne\\'s car. With his front tires spinning wildly Bourne fights to straighten his car as another CRI sedan appears and tries to box Bourne\\'s car by sliding into his path. Bourne just manages to punch his car into the right rear of the CRI Sedan and race down the Avenue with Paz and the slightly damaged sedan in pursuit. Paz gains on him and Bourne is forced to swerve violently to deny Paz the kill shot he is all too capable of. Just ahead of Bourne, two government SUVs slide into the intersection completely blocking his path. Bourne instantly spins his car  degrees and continues on, barreling into the roadblock backwards. As Bourne\\'s car plows through the SUV\\'s he whips the wheel and his car spins through a reverse  as Paz and the other sedan race through the wreckage in Bourne\\'s wake. Paz and the CRI sedan are all over Bourne as he slides a right hand turn onto South St. as Paz and the CRI sedan overwhelm Bourne\\'s battered vehicle. On his police radio, Bourne singles out an NYPD officer (call sign Alpha-) racing toward the intersection just ahead. Bourne slows, then speeds up quickly to time it right: The CRI car almost hits his bumper, then has to accelerate through the upcoming intersection. As he does, the cop car Bourne was listening to on the radio slams broadside into the CRI sedan drafting the bumper of the mangled cop car. Swerving wildly Paz avoids the pileup and slams his heavy SUV into the back of Bourne\\'s car, pushing him into the oncoming traffic. Several cars swerve left and right as Paz pushes Bourne sideways onto the ramped end of a K-Rail dividing the street ahead. The nearly upended car grinds down the K-Rail until the rear of Bourne\\'s car strikes an obstruction which punches it back into the lane as it slams against the front of Paz\\'s SUV, knocking the SUV sideways, into a row of parked cars. Bourne\\'s car hits parked cars on the other side of the road. SMOKE and STEAM -- SIRENS -- CHAOS BOURNE kicks the window out of the police car.   Gun up... Ready-- A    PAZ in the car. Still. Bloody from the crash, really A fucked up. He comes to...and Bourne is there. Gun pointed at his head... The two assassins look at each other...then Bourne lowers his gun...and disappears... ON PAZ -- as the wheels start to turn... The asset lost Bourne.   We lost him. Vosen reacts-- Bourne exits from the subway.   Bourne walks north. Wills pacing... Bourne\\'s profile is up on Screen . It says \"David Webb (AKA Jason Bourne)\" on the profile.  A tech comes to Wills. Sir, this may be nothing but, look at Bourne\\'s birthday. Wills looks at the profile.   Bourne\\'s birthdate is listed as //. What about it? Well, Landy told Bourne his birthday was // so... Wills gets it instantly. Everything stops. (they\\'re listening) New assignment. Numbers. Four. WILLS (cont\\'d) Fifteen. Seventy-one. What do they mean? Wills grabs his headset-- A CRI agent approaches Vosen. Landy gave Bourne a false birthday. Wills thinks it\\'s a code. It sinks in for Vosen...oh...shit... BOURNE emerges into the crowed street, headed uptown. Wills watches the techs work. -- if you plug them in as variants of latitude and longitude you get Cameroon -- Peru -- Colombia -- -- San Francisco\\'s got a four-one- five area code -- --  is the zip code for Varney, Kentucky -- -- there\\'s no  West st Street, but there is a  East st -- -- if it\\'s a substitution code, we\\'re way short on variables, which I -- (no chance to finish as-- ) --hang on -- wait -- Seventy First Street? Like what? Like York and First? That\\'s correct. Wills like he\\'s been hit.   Like hard.   As we cut to -- They race uptown. She gave him the facility.     She gave him-- I know. Go! Go! Drive! We\\'re already on our way. Turn the teams around. Bring them in behind me. Vosen steely eyed as they race uptown.    He dials a number-- Bourne reaches st street and nd Ave.    He looks up at the sign... Hirsch\\'s office is located in the SRD\\'s \"front office\", which is located covertly on a floor of the new building of the hospital. He is the longtime head of SRD and a powerful behind-the-scenes official at CIA. DR. HIRSCH, , is, put simply, not a man to be trifled with. He\\'s a  year CIA veteran. One of the great brains in the Agency\\'s history, but also a man who knows how to wield power silently, invisibly, and to tremendous effect. His phone buzzes. Hello. VOSEN at the other end of the line -- Bourne knows everything. I think he\\'s heading for you right now. Dead pause. He\\'s coming home, Noah. There\\'s a wistfulness in the way he says it. But also the sense that this was absolutely inevitable. And he\\'s calm about it, doesn\\'t show any fear, doesn\\'t reach for a gun. How long do I have? Not long.    Get out of there. No.   I\\'m going to stay. Are you crazy, he\\'ll-- He\\'ll come to the training wing. That\\'s what he knows. I\\'ll keep him in play until you arrive. Bourne arrives at the \"Johnston Medical Center.\"   He looks up to see \"\". The image of \"\" that has been haunting his dreams. This is the place... When he looks down Landy steps out of the lobby to meet him on the sidewalk. They\\'ll kill you for giving me this place. // isn\\'t much of a code. My guess is Vosen\\'s already on his way. Why\\'d you do it? This isn\\'t us, David. What they turned you into, what they\\'re doing with Blackbriar... This has to stop. Then stop it. Everything you need is in there. Bourne hands her the black bag and enters the hospital. David... Come in with me. It\\'s better if we do this together. This is where it started for me, this is where it ends. She watches the doors close behind him....     Landy lets him go. QUICK SHOTS of six different CRI sedans and SUVs rushing toward the hospital. Landy looks in the backpack. --She unzips the backpack and looks in at the the Blackbriar Operations File. --A cover page inside: \"utmost secrecy\"... \"potentially explosive public reaction would jeopardize the program\"... --Another page: \"Terminated\" stamped across the photos of victims. Next to the victim from the inciting incident, the words: \"US citizen\"... Oh, my God... --A third page, more photos, no \"terminated\" on these. Future victims. \"US citizen\" stamped next to each one... Bourne uses the card reader he took from Vosen\\'s safe to enter a \"restricted access elevator.\"   A guard comes. Bourne aims his pistol at him as the elevator door closes. Landy walks down the street. She looks up to spot two black sedans speeding east on st, turns south -- two SUVs coming up York.   Shit-- A block south of the hospital, stuck in traffic, Vosen points. Landy! Right there!    She\\'s got Bourne\\'s backpack! Bourne flips up the elevator stop button and uses the access card to enter a secure corridor-- Landy runs across the lobby. Vosen\\'s SUV careens to a stop behind a bunch of traffic. Still a half block from the entry door but it\\'s close enough-- Bourne rushes down a nondescript corridor-- Vosen and CRI agents rush into the lobby. (to a group of six agents) I\\'ll find Landy. You get to the training wing and get Bourne! A security guard comes over. Do you know who I am? Where\\'s your security room? Landy looks around. Finds an open office. She pushes open the door and runs to the fax machine. She starts faxing the Blackbriar documents Bourne took from Vosen\\'s safe. Vosen enters. I want to see all your footage for the last three minutes. Bourne stares down the corridor from his dreams, the corridor Daniels lead him down in his flashback. We see Bourne go into-- That first day, Bourne\\'s POV being led down this corridor by Daniels. Bourne moves down the corridor. Bourne reaches the end of the hall.       He looks around \"flashback style\" -- Bourne was standing at this door.... Vosen enters the room.    The last pages have been faxed... You better get a good lawyer. She exits... Then spins, gun up-- Hirsch is there, halfway down the corridor behind him. Put the gun down. I wouldn\\'t be here if I didn\\'t want to talk. I\\'ve spent three years running. Three years trying to find out who I was. Hirsch moves toward Bourne, completely unfazed by the gun. You still don\\'t have it all back, do you? You haven\\'t filled in all the pieces? Let\\'s start with the moment you found out I wouldn\\'t execute Wombosi. The amnesia wasn\\'t the issue, it was the fact that I didn\\'t pull the trigger.... One lapse meant your conditioning had failed. Bourne grabs Hirsch and slams him against the wall It was always you, behind Conklin, behind Abbott.... They were just following orders. Bourne grabs Hirsch and pushes him to the wall.   Searches him for weapons. I\\'m unarmed, Jason. (shoving Hirsch hard against the wall) \"David.\" I\\'m David Webb. CLOSE ON Bourne\\'s face-- You were David Webb, but not anymore. Bourne stands with Hirsch. Why me?   Why did you pick me? A beat... You really don\\'t remember, do you? You picked us, Jason. What does that mean? You volunteered. Hirsch uses his free hand to hit the keypad on the wall. The \"room in use\" sign lights up. Bourne looks up \"flashback style\"-- Bourne remembers that keypad, that \"room in use\" sign from the first day... Bourne and Hirsch enter... You volunteered right here.... You didn\\'t even blink, Jason. You just handed me these... Hirsch removes a pair of dog tags from his jacket pocket. Holds them out to Bourne. Bourne takes the dog tags.        Stares at them. INSERT of the dog tags: Webb, David O Negative Catholic Bourne hands over his dog tags.... Has everything been explained to you. Yes, sir. You were a soldier ready to serve his country. Just like thousands of others, except you were a prodigy with languages...and a perfect shot. Your missions will save American lives. You said I\\'d be saving American lives. Instead you just turned me into a killer. Bourne raises the gun to Hirsch. You could have left at any time. And you knew exactly what it meant for you if you chose to stay. When we\\'re finished with you, you\\'ll no longer be David Webb. I\\'ll be whoever you need me to be, sir. Stop running from the truth, Jason. You chose to come here! You chose to stay! And no matter how much you want to forget it...eventually you\\'re going to have to face how you chose, right there, to become Jason Bourne! Bourne sitting in a chair, looking terrible.     Hirsch looks at him from behind the desk... You haven\\'t slept for a long time have you David? Have you made a decision? This can\\'t go on, you know. You have to decide. Who is he? We\\'ve been through that. What did he do? It doesn\\'t matter. You came to us. You volunteered. You said you\\'d do anything it takes to save American lives. You\\'re not a liar are you? Or too weak to see this through? This is it. Let go of David Webb. Will you give yourself to this program? You\\'re no longer David Webb. From now on you\\'ll be known as Jason Bourne. Welcome to the program. He\\'s ready. Send him to Operations. Do you remember now? I remember. I remember everything. You can\\'t outrun what you did, Jason. You made yourself into who you are. I\\'m done running.  That\\'s why I\\'m here. To end you, to shut this down. I\\'m no longer Jason Bourne. So now you\\'re going to kill me? No. You don\\'t deserve the star they give you on the wall at Langley. Why didn\\'t you take the shot? Do you even know why you\\'re trying to kill me? Look at what they make you give. FBI agents arrested several senior CIA officials today in connection with the broadening scandal enveloping Washington today-- Assassination program code-named \"Blackbriar\" was exposed by a former assassin named David Webb-- - Program reportedly targeting US Citizens in some cases... CIA Director Ezra Kramer produced explosive documents for the Senate Committee indicating \"Blackbriar\" was authorized at the highest levels of government. Webb, who was known inside the intelligence community, as \"Jason Bourne\" jumped from the fourteenth floor of the CIA facility where he was trained in New York into the East River below.   While experts say it would be nearly impossible to survive the fall, despite two weeks of efforts, his body has still not been recovered.'"

      "But I'm not done with the machine --\n",
      "Speaker: VICTOR\n",

Reed, what are we doing here?  This guy\\'s fast-food, strip-mall science -- This wasn\\'t our first stop, in case you forgot NASA.  And Victor\\'s not that bad.  He\\'s just a little... (seeing the statue) Larger than life. He\\'s financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century. You\\'d never know it. Jesus.  That too? Reed Richards and Ben Grimm to see -- Executive elevator, top floor. What\\'s the price for a smile round here? My research suggests that exposure to a high-energy cosmic storm born on solar winds might have triggered the evolution of early planetary life. In six weeks another cloud with the same elemental profile will pass Earth\\'s orbit.  A study in space could advance our knowledge about the structure of the human genome, and help cure countless diseases, extend human life -- Give kids the chance to be stronger, healthier, less prone to -- Turn it off.  Please. But I haven\\'t fully explained my -- Yes you have... Imagination. Creativity.  Passion.  Those were always your trademarks. But dreams don\\'t pay the bills, do they? (a condescending smile) Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist.  Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back. You remember in school we talked about working together.  That\\'s what I was about to explain... So it\\'s not my money you want.  It\\'s my toys... Tell me: if NASA doesn\\'t trust you, why should I? That\\'s my job.  To stay a step ahead.  To know what other men don\\'t. I can\\'t take this. (low, quiet) Ben.  This is business.  Just work. He\\'s right, Ben. It\\'s just business. I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm. Heya Susie. (under breath, to Reed) One more thing he\\'s got. Ben, it\\'s been too long. You\\'re, you\\'ve, I mean, how have you bee-- Never better. This isn\\'t going to be a problem, is it? Not at all. Ancient history. Good.  Then you\\'re just in time to hear the great Reed Richards ask me for help. (to Reed) You know, you made a lot of folks at MIT feel like a junior high science fair.  So you\\'ll excuse me if I savor the moment. You back this mission, and I\\'ll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or -- The number\\'s seventy-five.  And it\\'s applications and patents. What about his first born? (quiet) Ben, the money\\'s not important.  We could save lives. Twenty-five percent of a billion is enough to keep the lights on, isn\\'t it?  Maybe even pay off your fourth mortgage on the Baxter Building. Deal...? Well then, to our future.  Together. Funny how things turn out, isn\\'t it? Hilarious. If Reed\\'s right, then this little trip will double our stock offering. And if he\\'s not...? Reed\\'s always right.  Good thing he doesn\\'t always know what he\\'s got... He knew about NASA.  What if he made the call to shut us down -- Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works -- Maybe you should think about yourself for once.  You always let this guy push you round -- We got what we wanted.  That\\'s enough. I know, I know.  I\\'m just worried about what he wants... Speaking of which... You sure about this, Reed? Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and -- I was talking about us.  Working together. (thinking, talking fast) Well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and I\\'ll focus on the molecular physics.  Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho-- (droll, a little annoyed) Right.  That\\'s exactly what I meant. Way to not overthink it. (to Sue) So when do we leave? I\\'ll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew. I, uh, think I remember the number. It\\'s been changed. As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission -- Well, he\\'s welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.  You remember my brother Johnny... Can\\'t do it.  I cannot do it. External SRBs, orbital system engines.  Its just like the shuttles you flew in -- No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight  simulator. Youthful high spirits. They crashed it into a wall.  A flight simulator. I\\'m sure he\\'s matured since then. When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do? Five times. I had it at four. This makes five. Captain on the bridge! Digital camera: $254.  Memory stick: $59.  The look on your hard-ass former CO\\'s grill when he finds out he\\'s your junior officer: priceless. I can handle the ship.  I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition.  But I don\\'t know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits.  Who the hell came up with them? Victor did. The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to -- Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool! Wow.  Fantastic. Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.  I\\'ve been working on a formula for this. Great minds think alike. Guess some think faster than others. I hired Armani to design the pattern.  These colors will look great on camera. They\\'re ready for you, sir. Showtime. Our numbers are through the roof.  The IPO\\'s tracking at fifty, sixty a share.  The bank\\'s five times oversubscribed -- It\\'s not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep. Then what is it? History, Leonard.  History.  Everything else is conversation... (a beat) How\\'s the other matter? Harry Winston sends his regards. Today we stand on the edge of a new frontier.  In the furthest depths of outer space...we will find the secrets to inner space.  The final key to unlocking our genetic code lies in a cosmic storm... Isn\\'t that your speech? He\\'s made a few changes. This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there. Victor\\'s better at these things. I\\'ll be watching over you. Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom. Soon as I\\'m back, I\\'m gonna trade that in for a bigger rock. I don\\'t care about rocks, I care about you. (to Reed) You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man. What the hell you smiling at?  Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs -- Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant.  Couple generations past your last ride. (at the threshold) I\\'m not as dumb as you look. Think of a world without genetic flaws -- no asthma, allergies, baldness, breast cancer... What\\'s wrong with being bald...? Darwin discovered evolution.  Now we -- I -- will define it.  Only in America could... ...a little country boy from Latveria build one of the biggest companies in the world, and truly reach the stars.  Now if you\\'ll excuse me, history awaits... (a \"dad voice\": to Ben) If you behave, maybe next time daddy\\'ll let you drive. Keep talking, there won\\'t be a next time. Long way from the projection booth at the Hayden Planetarium, isn\\'t it? Yes.  Yes it is. (to ground; via comm-link) Leonard, how\\'s the feed? Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly. We can monitor the cloud\\'s approach and observe the tests from here. Is it safe? The shields on the station should protect us. Should? What\\'s wrong, Ben?  Eighty-million dollars worth of equipment not enough for you? Let\\'s start loading those samples.  Get your suit ready, Ben. So you still do all the heavy lifting? Maybe you should have stayed back in the lab.  Field work never suited you. He does the talking.  I do the walking.  Got it? Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I\\'m going to borrow Susan for a second. Sure. Please tell me your dawg\\'s not trying to rekindle things with my sister. \\'Course not.  Strictly business. Yeah, well, his eyes say different. Hey, two hearts got busted last time.  Maybe she\\'s not over it either. Let\\'s see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world\\'s dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it\\'s a toss-up. Put your tiny little mind at ease. Don\\'t you wander off, boy. Surprised I agreed to Reed\\'s proposal? I understand the business reasons. Well, when you\\'re looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past. Susan, every man dreams that he\\'ll meet some woman he can give the world to. In my case, it\\'s not just a metaphor. No...no...impossible.  It\\'s...too fast. You\\'ve been with me two years now. It\\'s been a good two years, Victor... The company\\'s accomplished so much. Right, of course, the company... But you see, I\\'ve come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with -- Uh, Victor, I hope I haven\\'t done something to make you think... Sue, I\\'ve lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a promotion.  A merger of sorts... (getting closer) Four little words that can change our lives... The cloud is accelerating! I don\\'t know what happened. We\\'ve got minutes until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm\\'s deadly -- the radiation\\'s lethal.  We need to abort. Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn\\'t come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields... Ben\\'s still out there -- So reel him in.  But we came here to do a job.  So let\\'s do it.  Quickly. Ben, we need you back inside. I ain\\'t done arranging your flowers, egghead. Ben.  This is serious.  Turn around. Roger that, on my way. Event threshold in two minutes. Come on, Ben, come on... Reed, we\\'re running out of time. Johnny... Reed... Reed, you need to get up here so we can close the shields!  Now! Not until Ben is back inside! It\\'s too late for him, and soon it\\'ll be too late for all of us. What are you doing? Raising the shields. You can\\'t leave them out there. Watch me.  Reed had his chance.  You can\\'t help them any more than I can. I can try. Victor\\'s right.  Johnny, get to the command center.  Close the shields. What about you? (to Ben) Come on big guy, you can do it! Event threshold in thirty seconds. Event threshold in ten seconds.  TEN... Johnny!  Reed! FIVE...FOOOOUUUR... He\\'s not responsive -- Ben!  Ben! Ben, wake up!  Wake up! Where...where am I? Back on Earth.  Victor\\'s medical facility... We\\'re in quarantine. Reed? ... Sue? They\\'re fine.  Everybody else...is fine. What\\'s wrong with me? I swear to you they\\'ve done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best -- Give me a mirror... They said that\\'s not such a good idea, the shock alone could -- Give me the god damn mirror! Unfortunately, the doctors just couldn\\'t do anything to fix your face! Nice \\'do.  Going for the \"grandpa\" look? You\\'ve been accused in the past of moving science a little too fast -- Accused by who?  My competitors? But surely this accident gives you pause -- Danger is always part of discovery.  What would have happened if Ben Franklin never went out in a storm? Without risk, there\\'s no reward. So where\\'s the reward?  You promised a cure-all. And you\\'ll have it.  I\\'ve never come up short.  And I\\'m not going to start now. So you\\'re still taking VDI public -- Yes, of course.  I\\'ve never been more confident in the compan-- How\\'s she doing? Stable.  Vitals are strong. Blood panels show no irradiation.  Good.  You\\'ll step up this protocol, every -- Four hours.  We know what we\\'re doing... One more day of observation, then you\\'re all cleared.  Sue...I want to tell you...I\\'m... She\\'s allergic to orchids.  Put that Amaryllis Apapathos by her bed.  The African lilies?  They\\'re her favorites. And where do we think we\\'re going? I don\\'t know if \"we\\'ve\" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window -- I\\'ve noticed... But doctor\\'s orders, you\\'re not allowed to leave until we -- Finish the tests, I know -- could you give me a hand with this zipper? You know this is not a ski resort. Not yet. Luckily grandma still sends care packages. You are trouble. (thermometer in his mouth) Brubbles my Triddle Name. You\\'re hot! So are you! I mean, you feel a little feverish. I\\'ve never felt better in my life.  When do you get off work? My shift ends at four, but I couldn\\'t -- Meet me at 4:01, top of the run.  That\\'ll give you a minute to freshen up. How long was I out? Three days.  I was worried about you.  How are you feeling? Solid. How you doing? I don\\'t know.  I just keep going over and over the numbers. Reed.  Even you can\\'t compute every little thing. I should have done more, run more tests -- It was a freak of nature.  Last I checked, you don\\'t have a crystal ball.  Let it go. You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life. Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect -- Reed, I\\'m not talking about Debbie. What?  Come on.  She\\'s got a good thing with Victor -- I\\'m sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws? He\\'s smart, powerful, successful -- Well maybe you should date him. Ben.  He\\'ll give her the life she deserves.  She ended up with the right guy.  Things worked out for the best. Do I have to do everything myself? Me like-y. Stay right.  Left is trouble. I though we went over this. Last one down springs for room service. You\\'re on fire! Not this again -- No: You\\'re ON FIRE! Care to join me? How\\'s the IPO? Stable.  We\\'re looking at low twenties.  It\\'s a good number, considering the fallout from -- Reed\\'s disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose. Sir, I\\'m sure he wouldn\\'t put himself -- Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal... (staring into silver tray) I\\'ve got to do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side. Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar \"humanizes\" you. And that\\'s a good thing? You know, maybe you should get some rest -- Later.  First, I\\'ve got some unfinished business.  A deal that needs closing... Sir, I\\'ve always wondered... Why Sue?  You could have any woman in the world but -- That\\'s why.  Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar \"why England,\" he said, \"because it\\'s not mine.\" I can only stay for one drink, Ben.  I\\'ve got to meet with Victor. Wouldn\\'t want to keep Vic waiting. Hey Reed, what are you doing here? (before he can answer) Great, why don\\'t you join us? God, I\\'m starving.  Gonna hit the buffet. Pardon me... Are you alright? I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp. Really bad shrimp. Feeling better? Yes, thanks. That\\'s good.  That\\'s uh...good. You always had a way with words. (an awkward beat) I should be getting back. I\\'m really happy for you and Victor. You\\'re happy for me and Victor. I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship -- Which was? Passion. For science. (frustrated) You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it\\'s explained to you in quantum physics. What?  What did I say? It\\'s never what you say.  It\\'s what you don\\'t say. What you don\\'t do... I...I...I just wanted to -- It\\'s been two years, and all you can say is you\\'re happy for me and some other guy... (standing up, hurt) You know, Victor may be a lot of things, but at least he\\'s not afraid to fight for what he wants... (Reed looks down) And it\\'s nice to be wanted sometimes.  To be heard...seen... Reed, look at me. Uh, Sue...?  I can\\'t. What?  What do you mean you -- Sue...look at your hands. You guys will not believe what just happened! It has to be the cloud.  It\\'s fundamentally altered our DNA. Let\\'s not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap. Now what is up with that? (deadpan) The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA. Cool.  What\\'d it do to you guys? Apparently I can disappear. Please tell me you go silent too.  We have to find Ben. Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame off -- Johnny. Stop it. Okay, \"mom.\" Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my nurse! Ben, are you there? Open up Ben, we need to talk. LEAVE ME ALONE!!! Ewwwwwwww.  That is disgusting. ...Ben? What is that thing? I think that thing is Ben. What\\'s going on? Victor, are you feeling alright? Just a little banged up.  A couple scrapes.  Why? Ben did this. Ben did this? He\\'s had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud.  And he\\'s not the only one. We need to find him. Victor, I\\'m sorry I -- (cold) Just find him. Anybody know where the big guy\\'s going? He\\'s going home. Hello, Operator? Deb... It\\'s me.  I need you to step out front. Out front?  You home, baby?  I got a surprise for you. I got a surprise for you too. Ben? Don\\'t come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said \"together forever no matter what\"? Baby, you\\'re scaring me. Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben? Deb, it\\'s me.  It\\'s still me. Don\\'t...don\\'t...DON\\'T TOUCH ME! I love you, Deb. Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don\\'t need this to hit the press. Yes sir.  You\\'ve got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal -- Front page? Top left, like you asked. (a smile) Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington. Leonard.  Think bigger. A few days in space, it\\'ll be great, what\\'s the worst that could happen? Perfect.  Thanks. You think you got trouble?  Take a good look, pal, how bad could it be? Okay, easy there, buddy. You had to choose my spot, didn\\'t you? This is really not my day. A little help here?!  You wanna hit that button, sir? FREEZE!  PUT THE MAN AND THE SEAT DOWN! Not even Ben deserves that. Back!  We\\'re evac-ing the bridge.  What now?  Reed...?  What do we do? Ben\\'s out there.  Let\\'s go get him. Maybe you didn\\'t hear me.  Those cars are gonna blow sky high, any second. Look, we\\'ve got a friend out there in trouble.  We need to get to him before -- Nobody gets past this point. What? (mutters) We need to get past them. What the hell is this?  A magic show? Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them. What...? (realizes) Oh. This is wrong in so many ways. You\\'ve been working out. Shut up. Any more ideas, Reed?  Maybe you should strip down next, see how it feels to have fifty people staring -- Uh, Sue? Oh.  Well then... I\\'m gonna need serious therapy. What the --! Ben.  Are you okay? Am I okay?!  You wanna explain that?!  Or this?!  What the hell am I? \\'Cause I sure ain\\'t Ben anymore. REED!  BEN!  LOOK OUT! I swear to you, I will do everything in my power until there is not a breath left in me: you are going to be Ben again. Uh, sir...Larry King called, to cancel. (seeing the TV, a beat) Apparently, there\\'s a bigger story. There\\'s some folks outside, want to talk to you. We\\'re not going public with this.  We\\'re scientists, not celebrities. Too late, son. That\\'s what they\\'re calling you.  The Fantastic Four. Nice. Johnny, slow down.  Let\\'s think this through, a second. Okay.  Done thinking. So which one of you\\'s the leader? That\\'d be me. No seriously. You\\'re on, son.  They all want a statement. Uh, during our recent mission to the Von Doom space station, we were exposed to as yet-unidentified radioactive energy, most likely some kind of nucleotide compoun-- What happened on the bridge?  Does it hurt to stretch?  Were you really on fire?  Is it true that one of you can fly? Working on it.  And it\\'s a lot harder -- We don\\'t know much more than you do, at this point.  Which is why we will be going directly to the lab, where we can diagnose our symptoms and -- Symptoms?  So it\\'s like a disease? Symptoms?  Please.  If having powers is a disease, then yeah we got it.  And we are gonna blow your minds.  There\\'s a new day dawning.  The day of the Fantastic Four. That thing doesn\\'t look too fantastic. Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who\\'s been through a terrible orde-- What he\\'s trying to say is: every team needs a mascot... Look, we went up to space to find a way to understand DNA, to cure disease, save lives.  Well, now it\\'s our DNA, our disease, our lives on the line... (a beat) Thank you.  No more questions. Be nice. Well, Victor, the bank would like to congratulate you.  On the fastest freefall since the Depression.  We can\\'t even give your stock away. Ned, you know I can turn this around. You promised a cure-all, and came back with this.  Who the hell\\'s going to invest in a biotech company that turns its workers into circus freaks? (pointed) I really appreciate all your support. You\\'ve got a week, Victor.  One week to turn this around.  Or we pull out... (a beat) This meeting is over. Goddamn book-keeper doesn\\'t know preferred stock from livestock. Sir.  Reed\\'s comments at that press conference killed us.  How are we going to turn this around? Very simple.  I cure them.  If I can cure these freaks, then I can cure anyone.  What better way to restore my reputation? Smile, Ben.  They want to like you.  Give \\'em your good side.  Or your less bad side. Uh...don\\'t do drugs. Welcome back to the Baxter, Dr. Richards.  All that for you? I\\'m afraid so... Jimmy.  Good to see you again. Good to see you too... Don\\'t worry, sir.  I know how crowded that head of yours is. Any visitors while I was away? Just the usual.  Told \\'em you were circling round outer space. We had a tough year. Yeah, nine years straight. Twenty?  From outside the place looks a lot taller. Oh, it is. Either we\\'re moving really fast...or not at all. I\\'ll take the stairs. How come Ben can\\'t turn it on and off like us? That\\'s what we\\'re here to find out. If it happened to him, then it could... Wait.  You mean there\\'s chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?  Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life? Is that a trick question?  C\\'mon, I can\\'t be the only one who thinks this is cool. We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes... This place is deluxe.  You got cable? (hearing Ben\\'s FOOTSTEPS) ...and figure out how to reverse them.  Let me show you to your rooms. God, I\\'ve been so worried about you. Victor, your scar -- I told you, I\\'m fine.  It\\'s you I\\'m worried about. I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t get a chance to -- Please, no apologies.  I\\'ve arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You\\'ll have round-the clock care. Thank you, that\\'s generous, but I think I should stay here.  With my brother.  Until we get a handle on this. Sue.  I think you should let my doctors have a look at you. Victor!  What are you doing here? I\\'m starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you? Not much.  We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage. Well, let me know if there is anything I can do.  We\\'re all in this together now. Victor wait... I just wanted to say, I\\'m sorry the mission didn\\'t go as planned -- Didn\\'t go as planned?  It was a catastrophe.  You ruined the lives of four people -- I ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort -- Abort?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool -- Victor, if we could understand what happened to us -- I don\\'t want to understand it.  This isn\\'t one of your science projects.  I just want to fix it.  Fast! There a problem, Vic? No problem, Ben. Just pay your goddamn electric bill, and get to work on a cure. You got a chisel round here? If we\\'re going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes. We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped. Well why didn\\'t you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something? No, just sit back.  We have a good sense of your strength from the firetruck.  We need to find the source of your strength. How bad is it?  You know I used to smoke. Okay, this might smart a little. (high-pitched voice) We\\'ll...continue this later. Back it down, Johnny! I can go hotter! You\\'re really cramping my style here. You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you\\'re approaching supernova -- Sweet. That\\'s the temperature of the sun. Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth\\'s atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it. Gotcha.  Okay.  Supernova bad. He cooked the equipment. Okay.  I\\'ve uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal... Yeah. (a beat) You don\\'t wanna know the details. Ben, I\\'m afraid I\\'ve got to ask -- Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your -- O-kay.  We\\'ll skip that question. Is there something about flames?  About flaming, that you -- What are you trying to say?  Just because I dress well and like to dance -- (confused) What?  No.  I\\'m trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms. Oh, well that\\'s easy: I\\'m hot.  You\\'re...well, you\\'re a little limp.  Sue\\'s easy to see through.  And Ben\\'s always been a hardass. (a beat) Why aren\\'t you writing this down? It\\'s not \"invisibility\" per se.  You\\'re bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field.  That\\'s what you projected on the Bridge. What about you?  You haven\\'t eaten in days.  How come you\\'re never on this side of the microscope? Bruises...from the bridge? Have you had any side-effects, from your powers? I\\'ve had some headaches.  Migraines. You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better -- Excuse me? I\\'m saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when -- Anger.  Rage.  Frustration. Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or... (staring right at him) I\\'m sure I can come up with something. How\\'s that coming -- whoa -- I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry, I didn\\'t mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or -- What in the world would give me that idea? I mean, you broke up with me, right? Are you kidding? No, I distinctly remember: you walked out my door.  Ergo... Reed.  I was ready for the next step, you weren\\'t, ergo, I walked. I think it was a little more complicated than -- I just wanted to share an apartment.  What was so complicated about that? There were a lot of variables to consider -- No.  There weren\\'t.  There was you.  And me.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does. Sue...I just...I thought... Same old Reed.  Too much thinking... Okay guys, we have a serious problem. Our uniforms were exposed to the storm like us.  So they can transform like us, becoming invisible, changing size on demand or remaining impervious to flame. You look like an eighties rock band. (to Ben) The suit will stretch.  You should try it -- I wouldn\\'t be caught dead in that. He\\'s right.  These costumes are... missing something.  I can\\'t put my finger on it -- They\\'re not costumes. We\\'re not taking them out.  Johnny, we need to stay here till we\\'ve stabilized. I\\'m getting sick of being trapped here.  NASA wasn\\'t even this strict! (looking at uniform) Maybe it\\'s missing a utility belt.  So what\\'s the prognosis? Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing.  Every system is still functioning, somehow -- And they\\'re changing into... I don\\'t really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds -- Like the shields Reed said would protect us. (cold fury, deadly focus) How long? At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks -- What do you mean \"complete\"? I wish I could tell you.  I can\\'t pretend to know what we\\'re dealing with here.  I\\'ll notify the CDC and -- What? The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious -- Look at me.  I have a life.  I\\'m the face of a billion-dollar-company... We need to keep this confidential, understand? But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative... That\\'s terrible news... ...but I think I\\'ll get a second opinion. Nothing...nothing...nothing... Of course...of course...the cloud... What are you doing? (fast, charged) The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm. If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity -- (realizing) And reverse the mutations -- (talking more to himself) Curing countless diseases, not just ours. But we\\'re the focus, right Reed?  Reed...? Of course.  Of course. And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn\\'t work out so well. (preoccupied, mind spinning) With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into the city grid... You really need to get a janitor. This must be what it looks like inside your head. There\\'s a system to it. Wait!  Sue, don\\'t touch tha-- Sorry.  My fault.  I won\\'t...touch anything. Is Reed any closer to a cure? The only thing he\\'s closer to is Sue... Make me a reservation for two at Cipriani tonight. And get this over to Ben Grimm. Close your eyes, baby.  Keep \\'em closed. You surprised? Yeah I\\'m surprised.  Surprised the fire department didn\\'t shut this down. God.  I was good looking. What did you wish for, honey? I already got it.  Everything I want. Damn, Stretch! How far\\'s that rubber bend? That\\'s what I\\'m trying to calculate.  And it\\'s not rubber.  It\\'s muscle, tendon.  I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to -- Right, whatever, have fun. That\\'s not funny! Hey, that\\'s Ben Grimm there, the first mook from Brooklyn to go to outer space, so pay him some respect! Ernie.  Sorry for killing your business.  I\\'ll take the usual, then I\\'m out... Better make it a double. Who killed the party? Make it a triple.  On the house, Benny. If there\\'s a God, she hates me. I don\\'t think She\\'s real big on hate. You wouldn\\'t say that, if you could see me. Can I...?  See you...? It\\'s okay, I won\\'t bite... (feeling his arm) ...not that I could. Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn\\'t a bad thing. Trust me, this ain\\'t one of those times. See you round, Benny... I\\'m Alicia, by the way. Thank you for coming out to see me. You said it was urgent. It is.  There\\'s something we need to talk about.  Something I need to ask you... (slow, careful) Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I want you to know I appreciate everything you\\'ve done for me, but I just don\\'t -- Susan.  What are you doing? You think I brought you here to talk about us?  Please.  This is business. (leaning forward, intense) I need to know: how close is Reed to finding to a cure? He\\'s working round the clock.  But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before -- Same old Reed.  All analysis, no action.  Wasn\\'t that the problem with you two? If these molecules aren\\'t stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us. Then why is Reed dragging his feet?  Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass... (closer, cruel) It\\'s ironic, isn\\'t it?  You\\'re finally the perfect woman for him...because you\\'re his science project. Please don\\'t make this personal -- Oh, I think you already have. Victor, we can\\'t do anything until the research is ready. \"We,\" huh? Don\\'t forget who you work for, Susan.  So get to work.  And do your job. I wish my wife would disappear. And now, ladies and gentlemen, we have a special guest for you... Johnny Storm of the Fantastic Four! Hey, Ronnie Renner!  I\\'m a big fan. Heard you like to ride.  Wanna take her for a spin? Come on, bro.  I\\'ll teach you some tricks...if you can keep up. A rock-solid double-flip! Look at that lift, ladies and gentlemen! Frontside 360!  He\\'s totally flat and whipped! Whoa!  That\\'s a...what is that?  A 720? He\\'s going for a Kiss of Death! (hand over mic) Is he......flying? Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen!  You\\'ve just seen the first...the first...TORCHFLIGHT!  The McTORCH! My bad.  Sorry about that. (a glance to Ronnie) Thanks for the lesson, bro. That\\'s new... Have you read these...?  From all over.  People want us to fight crimes...  save their kids...solve their problems... (no response from Reed) ...when we can\\'t even solve our own. Reed.  How close are we to a cure? No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments. We\\'re not specimens, we\\'re patients.  This isn\\'t just another science project to you, is it...? NO...NO...NO FREAKIN\\' WAY!! BEN!  What?  What\\'s going on!? So what can you tell us about the outfit? Not too much, but I will say that it\\'s all weather and no leather.  Kind of Armani meets Astronaut. He didn\\'t. Oh, he did. What did he do to the uniform?! He talked me into it. So what are your superhero names? I go by the Human Torch.  The ladies call me Torch. What about the rest of the team? Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl. Girl...?! That\\'s easy to remember.  And Reed Richards?  He\\'s the leader.  So what\\'s he?  Mr. Fantastic? Well, I wouldn\\'t say he\\'s the leader. Could be worse. What about this one?  What do you call this Thing? That\\'s it.  Just The Thing.  We would have gone with The Rock, but it was taken.  And \"Thing\" pretty much sums it up. (matter-of-fact) Okay.  I\\'m gonna go kill him now. Ben!  Slow down a second and -- Is it true what they say?  That he can expand any part of his anatomy? Actually, between us, I think he\\'s got some problems staying rigid. (finishing his thought to Ben) ...wait for me... Which may explain why this woman\\'s not smiling. I\\'m driving. Dude.  That\\'s my sister. (looking around) Where\\'s my ride? What the?!  Is that my -- (shouting: to Ben) You\\'re gonna pay for that, Pebbles. (seeing Sue) What?! You gave us names?  What are you, the \"face\" of the Fantastic Four now? It\\'s about to be a broken face. This isn\\'t permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we\\'re normal again. What if some of us don\\'t want to be \"normal\" again?  We didn\\'t all turn into monsters like -- Did you just -- Okay, that\\'s it, tinkerbell!  You want to fly?  Fly. Let\\'s see if we can get blood from a stone. You two need a time-out. Blockhead started it! Damn it, Johnny. You need to control yourself and think before you -- Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling? A higher calling like getting girls and making money? Is there any higher? This is who we are Reed.  Accept it.  Or better yet: enjoy it. Ben!  Slow down... He didn\\'t mean it.  You know Johnny.  He\\'s always been a hothead -- It\\'s not him.  It\\'s them. (pointing to crowd) I can\\'t live like this. Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one -- It\\'s easy for you to be patient. No, it\\'s not.  I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We\\'re all in this together now, Ben. Together?  Look at me, Susie.  You got no idea what I\\'d give...to be invisible.  Your nightmare...is my dream. This is how you \"turn things around\"?  These freaks are on the front page and your company\\'s in the obituaries. I have a plan to use their publicity for -- Victor, stop.  The bank\\'s lost enough already.  This isn\\'t a negotiation.  It\\'s a notification.  We\\'re pulling out. You need to look long-term here.  Without risk, there\\'s no -- Reward.  We all know the sales pitch, Vic.  And frankly, we\\'re done buying... Gentlemen. Hello...? (relieved, almost) Von Doom?  Gave me a little shock.  No hard feelings, right?  Nothing personal. You know, you could always move back to Latvura, start fresh. Maybe that\\'s where you belong, back in the \"old country.\" It\\'s pronounced Latveria. (looking down at the dead body) This meeting\\'s over, Ned. ...the Fantastic Four put on quite a show last night.  They landed in every major headline in the northern hemisphere.  In related news... Reports have surfaced that Von Doom Industries may be filing for bankruptcy.  You may remember that it was Victor Von Doom who... Sir, is everything okay?  What happened to your...? (under breath, seething) Reed... He got what he wanted... (looking at Sue) Everything he wanted...he took from me. Now I\\'m going to take it back.  Piece by bloody piece... Victor, are you...are you okay?  Don\\'t worry about me.  Worry about yourself. What are you doing here? What I should have done a long time ago.  Applications and patents, Reed.  This all belongs to me. But I\\'m not done with the machine -- Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over.  It\\'s time for action.  My men could have mass- produced this by now. Mass-produced?  This isn\\'t a toaster.  You have no idea how it works. Re-create the storm, invert the polarity here, reverse the mutation there.  Don\\'t talk to me like I\\'m some schoolboy.  I\\'ve got the same Phd you do. The storm needs to be handled exactly right, or it could make our mutations worse, much worse, maybe even kill us... Victor, please.  We need time to verify the data... We can\\'t afford any mistakes -- there\\'s only enough ions for two or three attempts. Reed.  I\\'m not asking permission. (a final verdict) We\\'ll build it, while you check the specs. Can I talk to you? Don\\'t let Victor push you into making a mistake -- He was going to take away all my data, equipment -- Better than your life.  Victor\\'s not the one who has to get into that thing.  We are. Which is why I\\'m working twenty hours a day, checking every variable -- Every variable but yourself.  You don\\'t eat, sleep.  You can\\'t live in your head like -- (finally losing it) I\\'m not the only one in there.  I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there. So clear it out.  Get out of your head.  Get out of here... Mister, Mister!  Please help me!  My kitty is stuck in a tree. Please save Miss Lucy. (under breath) Eyebrows are a little big... I figured the only way to get you here was to stick that in the window. How\\'d you know it was me? I\\'m blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in? I\\'m not really dressed for a party. Relax, it\\'s casual. No, I mean...I\\'m a little...dusty...  Those yours too? My step-dad\\'s.  I\\'m strictly into stone.  I was wondering when you\\'d walk by. You know, you could\\'a run an ad in the personals. \"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship.\" This ain\\'t permanent.  My friend Reed\\'s working on a cure...I think. Bennie.  You feel pretty good as is. You don\\'t know what it\\'s like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering -- I wouldn\\'t know anything about that. I mean... Tell me.  When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know? (a beat) You went your own way then.  You didn\\'t listen to people.  So why start now...? Need a ride, Johnny? A few fans.  Hope you don\\'t mind. Gotta take care of the fans, right?  Look, I built my business knowing what people want.  And right now, the people want you. And we don\\'t want to let the people down now, do we? No we don\\'t.  Which is why we need to strike while the iron\\'s hot.  I\\'m talking action figures, videogames, sponsors -- Videogames?  You serious? You talk to Reed and Sue about this? Johnny.  Let\\'s be honest here.  Ben, Reed, Sue.  Good people, all.  But stars? (shaking his head, a beat) I don\\'t want to break up the band, but you\\'re the one they want.  Don\\'t you think it\\'s time to go solo...? Take the car for a spin.  Think about it.  Is this the life you want?  Or would you rather live in Reed\\'s lab...? I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter\\'s main power to generate enough voltage -- Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look up. Remember our first date here...?  God, I was so nervous. You were? Of course I was.  I\\'d read all your papers on bioethics.  Some of them two times just so I\\'d have something to say to you. You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late? I gave him twenty. I didn\\'t want that night to end. Sue, you were right.  It wasn\\'t complicated.  I just wasn\\'t ready to be...to become... (a beat) You can be a little intimidating.  You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  One who wasn\\'t afraid to tell you what he wanted. I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted you to be that man. When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door.  Ten.  Waiting for you to come find me. Why didn\\'t you say something? That would have kinda defeated the purpose.  And Reed... (closer, emotional) I\\'m saying it now. (quiet, playful) Come find me. That\\'s my nose, genius... These are my lips. Look around.  I\\'ll get us drinks.  They always let blind girls cut the line. I don\\'t know about this one.  It lacks a certain...realism. She\\'s always had a thing for runaways and strays, but this is ridiculous. I know.  Did she really think these sculptures would sell? Like anybody would want this thing in their house.  That girl\\'s a one-woman charity. This seat taken? What are you doing here? I\\'m worried about you. About me?  How sweet. Come on.  Let me buy you something to eat.  Looks like you could use the company. \\'Scuse me. I know it can\\'t be easy.  Life hasn\\'t changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back... If you\\'re trying to cheer me up you\\'re doing a helluva job -- I\\'m just saying, I know what it\\'s like to lose something you love.  To see it slip away, and know it\\'s never coming back. Reed\\'s gonna fix me up -- For your sake I hope you\\'re right.  I\\'m sorry if that sounds a little skeptical. Skeptical...? Look, he\\'s a brilliant man, we should trust he\\'s working as hard as he can.  You\\'re his best friend.  So what possible reason could he have for taking his time? (a beat) I mean, other than getting close to Sue? Yeah, I have that effect on people. Ben -- Oh, you remember my name do you?  You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body? We\\'re working as hard as we can -- Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right. Come on, this is nothing. Glad \"nothing\" could take you away from your work. Ben, I don\\'t know if this thing\\'ll change us back or make us worse.  I need you to be patient for a little while longe-- Look at me, Reed.  Look at me! I am looking.  That\\'s why I can\\'t make a mistake!  I\\'ve got to get it right, and it\\'s not right yet!  We need to test this. I spent my whole life protecting you, from the schoolyard to the stars.  For what?  So you could play Twister with your girlfriend while I\\'m the freak of the week? Ben!  Stop it!  Or I\\'ll stop it. Stay out of this Susie. Good thing you\\'re flexible enough to watch your own back.  \\'Cause you\\'re on your own now. I\\'m OK.  Just go, go after him.  Stop him. Christmas come early!  Check it out! IT\\'S CLOBBERIN\\' TIME! Hey!  That\\'s a prototype! Go back to the drawing board. Johnny?  Did you see Ben? Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I\\'m done with this freak show.  I\\'m moving back to the real world. Is that what you call it?  \"Real\"? At least it beats living in a lab like somebody\\'s science project. Johnny, slow down.  Think.  You know mom didn\\'t raise us to -- Look around, sis!  She\\'s not here.  So you can stop talking to me like I\\'m your little boy -- As soon as you stop acting like one.  Come on, you\\'re smarter than this.  You think those people out there care about you?  You\\'re just a fad to them. Let\\'s try something new: you live your life.  And I\\'ll live mine. (beat) And just for the record: they LOVE me. Oh god, Reed. What did you do, Reed?  What did you do? I can...make it work. Reed, stop, you need to rest your -- The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm -- You need a doctor. More power...? Leonard.  Bring me our lab rat. Ben!  They need you back at the Baxter building.  It\\'s...Reed. What do you say we get out of here?  This your boyfriend? Is that all you do?  Bar tricks and stealing chicks... What are you doing?!  You could have burned somebody! You know, if I had your power I\\'d be doing something with it, not wasting my time doing cheap bar tricks, hitting on some other guy\\'s girl. Ben, come in. What is this?  Where\\'s Reed? Where do you think?  With Sue. (quiet) I\\'ll take it from here, Leonard. Yes sir. What do you want, Vic? To help you.  I\\'ve run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready. Reed said it\\'d be weeks till -- He also said we\\'d avoid that storm in space.  And we know how that turned out. He couldn\\'t generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass.  Yet another mistake for \"Mr. Fantastic.\" And you can?  Power it up? Yes.  I\\'ve found a new energy source. Tell me...do you want to be Ben Grimm again? Let\\'s do it. Oh my God... Th-thank you.  THANK YOU...VIC?! Vic... What the...? Everyone thought I was safe behind those shields... Victor, the machine worked for me.  It can work for you -- It did, Ben.  It worked perfectly.  You planned this...? I\\'ve always wanted power.  Now I\\'ve got an unlimited supply... And no Thing to stand in your way.  Take a good look, Ben.  This is what a man looks like who embraces his destiny. One down, three to go. Right on cue. Oh god Ben.  Are you okay? (amazed) You did it, you really did it... No, Reed.  I did. Victor...?  What, what happened to you?  What did you do to your -- Exactly what I said I would: I built a better, stronger being.  And outsmarted the great Reed Richards -- Victor, this isn\\'t the way to -- (a dark smile) You always know best.  So tell me.  What happens when you superheat rubber? Mr. Von Doom?  Are you oka-- Never better, Jimmy.  And it\\'s Doctor Doom now. Why the long face? Ben?! Sue! I\\'m sorry, sis, for leaving you guys -- No, I\\'m sorry, for pushing you out. Jesus, Ben! (eyeing him) I go away, look what happens.  You got a lot of explaining to do. (struggling, weak) The machine works.  And Vic\\'s gone Mister Hyde on us -- Really?  With a name like Von Doom?  Never saw that one coming. Where is Reed? Victor must\\'ve taken him. Chemistry 101, Part Two.  What happens to rubber when it\\'s super- cooled? Allow me. Painful...? You don\\'t know the meaning of the word. But you will. Flame off. Great.  Heat-seeker. What are you doing -- Sis.  Let me take care of you for once. But Johnny...you can\\'t fly. Well then this\\'ll be one hell of a basejump. (under breath) Come on...come on...come on... FLAME ON. We need to help Reed -- Ben, you got what we all wanted.  You need to stay here.  It\\'s too dangerous. What...what have I done? What has he done to you? How romantic. Victor, please -- It\\'s Doctor Doom to you. We know the machine works.  It worked on Ben, it\\'ll work on you.  We can turn you back -- Do you really think fate turned us into gods so we could refuse these gifts? Victor.  You always thought you were god. Sue please, let\\'s not fight. No, Victor... Let\\'s. Susan...... You\\'re fired. Marco... Polo. One more down.  Now it\\'s just the scientist and his specimen. Sue.  The only thing I ever knew without thinking was... (his lips fully freezing) I...love... Me too, Reed. (quiet, cruel) And so four became none.  It\\'s my time now. Actually, Vic... IT\\'S CLOBBERING TIME! Damn, I\\'ve been wanting to do that. (Reed\\'s words) Victor\\'s \"not that bad,\" huh?  Just \"a little larger than life\"?  Maybe you\\'ll listen to me next time before -- Excuse me, Maam.  Can I borrow your car? The clutch sticks a little. Not gonna be a problem. I can\\'t let you do that. And you can\\'t stop me. Hello Susan. What is this?  The pitiful three? Four. Had a little relapse, huh? Welcome back. This is going to be fun. JOHNNY!  SPOT-WELD! Can\\'t...hold...on... Johnny.  SUPERNOVA. But all these people... Now. (quiet, smiling) Flame on, kid. Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration -- (looking at Doom) I\\'m sure I can come up with something. Is that the best you can do...?  A little heat...? Time for your lesson, Vic.  Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...? (to Ben) Ben... Got it, teach. No. Damn, I love this job. Job, huh...? Well, we do have the suits... You know, about what we said up there, I think maybe -- Funny how things turn out, isn\\'t it? Hilarious. Dude, that\\'s still my sister. Ben, I\\'ve been crunching the numbers on the machine.  I think if we can rework the power settings... Forget it, egghead.  I\\'m good as is. That\\'s my Benny. We\\'re going to have to work on your touch. I like the sound of that. Sue, can I talk to you for a second? I found a broken gasket, from space -- A gasket?  Reed, we\\'re at a party. If one of us were to wear it... Reed.  What are you doing? No more thinking, no more variables... Sue Storm...will you... (she\\'s gone) Sue?  Sue?  You there? Yes. That\\'s my nose, genius... These are my lips. No more cracks about how I look. Hey, I\\'m Mr. Sensitivity now. (weaving around bodies) Clear the way, wide load coming through. Showoff. '})"
